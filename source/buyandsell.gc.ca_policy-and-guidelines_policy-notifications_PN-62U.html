            <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification (PN)-62U is to update Incoterms 2000 and other miscellaneous shipping instructions, and related invoicing clauses. PN-62 was originally promulgated in May 2003 to introduce shipping clauses which use the Incoterm 2000 "FCA Free Carrier (...named place)" instead of Free on Board (FOB) Plant for Department of National Defence (DND) sole source contracts.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>The update to PN-62 on the use of Incoterms 2000 covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of applicable clauses is added to the Supply Manual (SM) (new procedure 6E.623) to assist contracting officers in deciding which shipping clause to include in their procurement document; and</li>
<li>Minor edits are made to the following clauses in the Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual:
<ul>
<li>Clauses D0035D and D0037D: Title change, telephone and text update;</li>
<li>Clause D0038D: Title change only;</li>
<li>Clauses D4000C and D4001C: Title change and Remarks update;</li>
<li>Clause D5543D: Text deleted in first sentence of last paragraph; </li>
<li>Clause D6006D: Superseded by clause D0035D or D0037D, as applicable; </li>
<li>Clauses H1000D and H1001D: Text update; </li>
<li>Clause H5001D: Text update; and </li>
<li>Clauses C2600T, C2600C, C2608D, C2610D, C5200T, C5200C and C5201C: Remarks update.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The attached revised clauses become effective immediately; therefore, contracting officers are asked to incorporate them into any future documents.</p>
<p>All changes shown in Annexes A and B (highlighted in <em>red</em>) will be incorporated into the next modification of the SM and SACC Manual.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Contracting officers are reminded to change the red text to black prior to cutting and pasting the updated clauses into their procurement documents.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>PN-62 was initially implemented on May 16, 2003 when an agreement-in-principle was reached between officials of the DND and Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) to use the Incoterm "FCA Free Carrier (...named place)", whenever possible, rather than Free on Board (FOB) Plant for all DND sole source contracts and all Repair and Overhaul (R&amp;O) contracts where transportation is not part of the competitive bid. It was agreed that DND will manage the inbound logistics for these contracts by being responsible for the transportation arrangements and associated risks, becoming the importer of record, and being able to invoke Remission Orders. For United States (U.S.) Foreign Military Sales contracts only (not all U.S. contracts) FOB Plant will continue to be used and DND will manage the inbound logistics on those contracts as well. </p>

Contracting officers should request prices with customs duty identified as a separate item. <em>(Clause D0035D or D0038D may apply.)</em></p>

<p>3. The Department of National Defence will be responsible for prearranging remission on importation or for paying customs duties on importation and applying to Canada Border Services Agency for a refund.
