            <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of Policy Notification (PN) 39U4 is to strengthen and clarify the implementation process in the Supply Manual (<abbr title="Supply Manual ">SM</abbr>) with respect to an Advance Contract Award Notice (<abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>).</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The Acquisitions Branch (AB) will be updating the current policy on <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> in the Supply Manual. This update is the result of an audit report by the Auditor General (AG) of Canada on <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>s. This audit report detailed that the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> used in a directed procurement did not comply with the intent of the applicable regulations and policies. The AG provided the following comments in this regard:</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>Lack of justification on the procurement file justifying a non-competitive approach in accordance with the exceptions for soliciting bids in the <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em> (<abbr title="Government Contracts Regulations"><a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a></abbr>).</li>

    <li>Insufficient information in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> to allow potential suppliers to determine if they possess the capabilities to satisfy the requirement.</li>

    <li>Lack of evidence on file that the pre-identified supplier was assessed against the same criteria used for all suppliers.</li>

    <li>Failure to issue a second <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> when significant changes to the requirement have occured.</li>

    <li>Misinterpretation of policies due to differences between various policies; e.g. competitive versus non-competitive contracts.</li>
    <li>Potential lack of fairness when meeting with the pre-identified supplier during the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> posting period.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Effective Date</h2>

<p>This <abbr title="Policy Notification ">PN</abbr> is effective immediately.</p>

<h2>Revisions to the current policy</h2>

<p>The following significant changes will be made to the current policy in Chapter&nbsp;3 of the Supply Manual relative to <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> terminology and procedures:</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>Clarification relative to file documentation procedures for <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>-related procurements; e.g. level of documentation to support the decision for an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>.</li>

    <li>Clarification regarding the inclusion of sufficient information in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> at posting time.</li>

    <li>Clarification of the need for all suppliers, including the pre-identified supplier, to be measured against the same criteria.</li>

    <li>Clarification of the need to amend an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> or to post another <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> if there is a significant change or if a significant clarification is required to the requirement.</li>

    <li>Deletion of references to the current Treasury Board (TB) Contracting Policy and the <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> Guide for Managers and clarification to the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>-related terminology and procedures to eliminate differences between the <abbr title="Supply Manual">SM</abbr> and the current <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> policy; e.g. competitive versus non-competitive contracts.</li>
</ol>

<p>With respect to the audit comment in item (f) of Background above, contracting officers are reminded that care should be exercised to ensure that any negotiations with the pre-identified supplier during the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> posting period do not put the pre-identified supplier at an advantage should a successful challenge take place before contract award. Furthermore, the pre-identified supplier must be cautioned not to commence any work or incur any costs before contract award. See <abbr title="Supply Manual">SM</abbr> <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/3/15/5/1">&nbsp;3.15.5.1 (b)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#annexa">Annex A</a> contains the changes to the Supply Manual. The procedures in 3.10 to <a href="#a315520">3.15.5.20</a>, <a href="#annex33">Annex 3.3</a> have been revised.</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>The <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em> (<abbr title="Government Contracts Regulations"><a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a></abbr>) require the solicitation of bids before any contract is entered into, though the <abbr title="Government Contracts Regulations"><a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a></abbr> do provide for exceptions to soliciting of bids.</li>

    <li>Whenever possible, contractors must be selected using a competitive process. The flexibility to depart from this approach depends on the procurement framework being followed. The type of competitive solicitation that may be used will also depend on the procurement framework.</li>

    <li>It is the contracting officer's responsibility to select the most effective process for notifying suppliers of an opportunity by taking into consideration the requirements of the trade agreements and the policies set out in the <em>Supply Manual</em>.</li>

    <li>For procedures relative to public advertisement and for publication of a Notice of Proposed Procurement and posting solicitation documents, see <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/4/75/10">4.75.10</a> to <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/4/75/25">4.75.25</a>.

<p>(<time datetime="2012-01-22">2012-01-11</time>)</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>In all instances where bids are not solicited, the legal authority to use an exception to soliciting bids must be fully justified by the client department with a reference to the applicable exception to competitive bidding which may apply under the <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em> (<a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a>) of the <em><a rel="external" href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/">Financial Administration Act</a></em>, and the limited tendering provisions of Canada's national and international trade agreements.

However, contracts may be entered into without soliciting bids when:

        <ol type="i">
            <li>The need is one of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest (<abbr title="Government Contracts Regulations"><a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a></abbr> 6.(a));
                <br>
                An emergency may be an actual or imminent life-threatening situation, a disaster which endangers the quality of life or has resulted in the loss of life, or one that may result in significant loss or damage to Crown property.</li>

            <li>The estimated expenditure does not exceed,

                <ol type="A">
                    <li>$25,000;</li>

                    <li>$100,000 where the contract is to be entered into by the member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada responsible for the Canadian International Development Agency and is for the acquisition of architectural, engineering or other services required in respect of the planning, design, preparation or supervision of an international development assistance program or project; (<abbr title="Government Contracts Regulations"><a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a></abbr> 6.(b))</li>

    <li id="a315d">There is a need to provide more rigor when invoking exception 6.(d) of the <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em> (<a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a>) where only one person is capable of performing the contract. When invoking exception 6.(d) for procurements above $25K, the questions found in <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/annex/3/1">Annex 3.1</a> must be answered by the contracting officer with the assistance of the client department. The answers to these questions must be appended to the approval documents and placed on the procurement file (see <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/6/5/5/1">6.5.5.1</a> and <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/annex/6/2">Annex 6.2</a>).</li>

    <li>With respect to the trade agreements, contracting officers may award a contract without soliciting bids, only if one or more of the limited tendering reasons stated in each applicable trade agreement can be applied. The relevant articles are as follows:

<h3 id="a3151">3.15.1 Justification of Non-competitive Process</h3>

<p>(<time datetime="2012-01-22">2012-01-11</time>)</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>While the client department must provide the rationale for any exception to soliciting bids, it is the responsibility of the contracting officers to make sure that the rationale can be adequately supported. Contracting officers are also reminded to take into account the procurement provisions under the Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements.</li>

    <li>If there is inadequate or no substantiation, the contracting officer should advise the client of alternative products or sources, if known, and attempt to reach agreement with the client on the most appropriate procurement strategy. When agreement cannot be reached by the contracting officer, the next level of management should be consulted.</li>

    <li>Use of any of the <abbr title="Government Contracts Regulations"><a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a></abbr> exceptions must be fully justified by the contracting officer with appropriate documentation that sets out the procurement strategy as well as the rationale for the exception used, placed on the procurement file (see <a href="#a315">3.15</a> and <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/6/5/1">6.5.1</a>). The trade agreements also contain provisions to document on file the reasons for the use of limited tendering and the appropriate article must be provided as justification, where applicable. (See <a href="#a315d">3.15(d)</a> and <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/3/25">3.25</a>(b)).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="a3155">3.15.5 Advance Contract Award Notice</h3>

<p>(<time datetime="2012-01-22">2012-01-11</time>)</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>An Advance Contract Award Notice (<abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>) is a public notice indicating to the supplier community that a department or agency intends to award a good, service or construction contract to a pre-identified supplier, believed to be the only one capable of performing the work, thereby allowing other suppliers to signal their interest in bidding by submitting a statement of capabilities. If no other supplier submits a statement of capabilities that meets the requirements set out in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>, the contracting officer may then proceed with awarding the contract to the pre-identified supplier. It is important to note that an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> is not a "competitive" process. Also of note is that an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> process, even if conducted in accordance with the Policy, does not constitute a "competitive" process for the purposes of the trade agreements and any Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) challenge. For the purposes of contract approval authorities only, a contract awarded after posting an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> for which no valid statement of capabilities is submitted within the notice period is a competitive (electronic) contract.</li>

    <li>The objectives of the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> process are to:

        <ol type="i">
            <li>provide a procurement process that is efficient and cost effective while being fair, open and transparent;</li>

            <li>provide potential suppliers with the opportunity to demonstrate, by way of a statement of capabilities, that they are capable of satisfying the requirements set out in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>; and</li>

            <li>respect the principles of government contracting by enhancing fairness, access and transparency.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>To provide transparency to the procurement process, an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> can be used only when there is sufficient justification for not soliciting bids in accordance with the exceptions of the <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em> (<abbr title="Government Contracts Regulations"><a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a></abbr>) and, if applicable, in accordance with the limited tendering reasons set out in the applicable trade agreements. (See <a href="#a315">3.15</a> and <a href="#a3151">3.15.1</a>)</li>

    <li>The <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> notice must be published on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) currently provided through MERX. However, before initiating the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>, contracting officers must ensure that:

        <ol type="i">
            <li>the requirement is sufficiently defined so that industry can understand the government's high level requirements;</li>

            <li>a justification is on file to demonstrate compliance with one of the exceptions of the <abbr title="Government Contracts Regulations"><a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a></abbr> and, if applicable, one of the exclusions or limited tendering reasons of the applicable trade agreements;</li>

            <li>a procurement plan or Contract Plan and Advance Approval (CPAA), as applicable, is placed on the procurement file before an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> is posted;</li>

            <li>the pre-identified supplier meets the same criteria to be used for assessment of other suppliers who submit statements of capabilities; and</li>

            <li>the procedures provided in <a href="#a315">3.15</a> to <a href="#a315520">3.15.5.20</a> are followed.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Contracting officers must ensure that Canada is in a position to accept a statement of capabilities before publishing an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>. For more information on the process relative to the statement of capabilities, see <a href="#a315510">3.15.5.10</a>. In circumstances where there is no possibility of another supplier submitting a statement of capabilities or where Canada cannot, for program or policy reasons, accept a statement of capabilities from another supplier, an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> must not be published. Accordingly, the use of an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> for non-competitive requirements is not mandatory and there is no requirement to seek approval not to publish an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> for a requirement. In such cases where the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> process is not used, the non-competitive approval authorities apply to the procurement strategy and contract award notices will be issued after contract award. (See <a href="#a315515">3.15.5.15</a> for <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> exceptions and <abbr title="Supply Manual">SM</abbr> <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/7/30">&nbsp;7.30</a> for contract award notices).</li>

    <li><abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>s are not to be used to circumvent electronic bidding or other bidding procedures when it is clear that more than one supplier exists that can perform the work.</li>

    <li><abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>s are not to be structured in ways that discourage submissions of statements of capabilities. For example, the <strong>notice should not say</strong>: "This is not a competitive solicitation", or "This is a non-competitive requirement".</li>
</ol>

<p>(<time datetime="2012-01-22">2012-01-11</time>)</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>Although <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>s are posted for a minimum of 15&nbsp;calendar days on <abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>, the contracting officer should consider a longer posting period based on the individual circumstances for each procurement. In determining the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> time limit, contracting officers must consider the complexity associated with the procurement.</li>

    <li>Furthermore, while for reasons of timeliness and efficiency, contracting officers may enter into negotiations with the pre-identified supplier before the closing of the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> posting period, care should be exercised to ensure that any such negotiations do not put the pre-identified supplier at an advantage should a successful challenge take place before contract award. In addition, the pre-identified supplier must be cautioned not to commence any work or incur any costs before contract award.</li>

<ol type="a">
    <li>The <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> process provides suppliers with an opportunity to submit a statement of capabilities regarding work identified in an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>.</li>

    <li>Statements of capabilities submitted by suppliers:

        <ol type="i">
            <li>should be provided in writing within the specified timeframe indicated on the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>; and</li>

    <li>Despite the timeframe indicated in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>, there may be circumstances when a contracting officer could consider a statement of capabilities received after the specified date but before the award of the contract. Contracting officers should discuss this with their management and Legal Services.</li>

    <li id="a315510d">Following receipt of a statement of capabilities, the process is as follows:

        <ol type="i">
            <li>All statements of capabilities received by the timeframe indicated in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> are reviewed by the contracting officer in accordance with the criteria provided in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>. The pre-identified supplier indicated in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> is also assessed against those same criteria. The assessment must be kept on file.</li>

            <li>When a supplier's statement of capabilities provides sufficient information to indicate that it meets the requirements set out in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>, the supplier is notified of the decision to compete the requirement before proceeding to a full bidding process.</li>

            <li>If a statement of capabilities is rejected, a separate review of the rejection is conducted. This review would be made at one level higher than the original approval authority, but not lower than that of Manager and not higher than the Assistant Deputy Minister.</li>

            <li>With respect to statements of capabilities that are rejected, suppliers should be advised in writing of the decision to reject a statement of capabilities before a contract is awarded.</li>

            <li>The reasons for the decision to reject a statement of capabilities are included in the file.</li>

            <li>Suppliers that have submitted a statement of capabilities are given the reasons why their statement of capabilities was rejected.</li>

            <li>The request from a supplier to withdraw/cancel its statement of capabilities is documented on file, and should be provided in writing by the supplier.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>If the procurement is being set aside under the Procurement Strategy for Aboriginal Business, statements of capabilities must only be considered from Aboriginal suppliers.</li>

    <li>If the requirement subject to an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> is cancelled, suppliers that submitted statements of capabilities should be notified in a timely manner.</li>

    <li>Contracting officers may request additional information from suppliers or third parties, as appropriate, to ensure that the interested supplier has the capability to meet the requirements set out in the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>.</li>

<ol type="a">
    <li>Contracting officers must ensure that Canada is in a position to accept a statement of capabilities before publishing an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>. In circumstances where there is no possibility of another supplier submitting a statement of capabilities or where Canada cannot, for program or policy reasons, accept a statement of capabilities from another supplier, then the contract should be awarded on a non-competitive basis with transparency achieved through a contract award notice. Examples of situations where an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> is not to be published include:

        <ol type="i">

            <li>regulatory body determined non-competitive service contracts (e.g. National Transportation Agency, Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission);</li>

<h3 id="a315520">3.15.5.20 Documenting the Procurement File</h3>

<p>(<time datetime="2012-01-22">2012-01-11</time>)</p>

<p>When the decision is made to proceed with an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr>, contracting officers are required to document the procurement file with the actions taken in each phase of the <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> process. Procurement files must include documentation of the following justifications, reasons and associated steps, as a minimum:</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>The rationale for the pre-identified supplier including the relevant exception to soliciting bids under the <abbr title="Government Contracts Regulations"><a rel="external" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/index.html">GCRs</a></abbr> and, as applicable, the limited tendering reasons under the trade agreements (see <a href="#a315">3.15</a> to <a href="#a3155">3.15.5</a>).</li>

    <li>The actions taken to determine if other suppliers may have been capable of performing the work. When an industry analysis is conducted to identify the possible companies that could perform the work and one company is identified but there is a doubt (or uncertainty) that there may be additional suppliers for this requirement, then an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> would be published. Justification of the only known supplier based on the industry analysis along with an approved procurement strategy must be put on the procurement file before an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> is posted; e.g. the identified supplier is the only known source based on the industry analysis. If an exhaustive industry analysis has been completed and there is no doubt that there is only one provider capable of performing this work, then a non-competitive process would be more appropriate and an <abbr title="Advance Contract Award Notice">ACAN</abbr> would not be posted.</li>
