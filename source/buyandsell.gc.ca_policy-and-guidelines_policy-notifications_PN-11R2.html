                        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>This  replaces Policy Notification PN-11R1&nbsp;of November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010&nbsp;in its entirety.  Policy Notification PN-11R2&nbsp;updates the 1996&nbsp;version of the Vendor Performance  Policy (VPP) and PN-11R1. These policy notifications clarify the purpose and  scope of the policy, and further standardize the processes and procedures  pertaining to the application of a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure  (VPCM). The fair, open and transparent treatment of vendors  will continue to be a fundamental principle of the policy.</p>
            <p>The policy name has been changed to the Vendor  Performance Corrective Measure Policy (VPCMP). From November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010&nbsp;to June 28,&nbsp;2011, the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> was implemented on an extended trial basis. Under the revised policy, terminations  for default and conditional amendments trigger the assessment process and ensuing consequences. However, for  any such events that occurred during the trial period there will be no  resulting consequences for vendors. As of June 29,&nbsp;2011, the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> is fully enforced for  the following:</p>
            <ol class="double-space" type="i">
            <li>sole source  contracts awarded on or after November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010; </li>
            <li>contracts  awarded pursuant to competitive solicitations (other than those in (iii) and  (iv) below) issued on or after November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010; </li>
            <li>call-up contracts under Standing  Offers awarded pursuant to a Request for Standing Offers issued on or after  November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010; and </li>
            <li>contracts under supply arrangements  awarded pursuant to a Request for Supply Arrangements issued on or after  November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010&nbsp;where <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>-<abbr title="Acquisitions Branch">AB</abbr> is the contract authority. </li>
          </ol>
            <p class="indent1">However, for the above transactions, it must be noted that no  consequences will be enforced against vendors for terminations for default  and/or conditional amendments that occurred between November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010&nbsp;and June 28, 2011&nbsp;inclusive.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, the provisions of the applicable  previous version remain in effect.</p>
            <p>The <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> applies only to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>-Acquisitions Branch as a common service provider  for transactions under its authority.</p>
            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>The application of  corrective measures against vendors that do not fulfill their contractual  obligations was introduced under the 1996&nbsp;version of the VPP. Such measures  have an impact on a vendor‚Äôs ability to bid on future opportunities with, or  receive contracts from <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>. Acquisition Branch‚Äôs review of the policy  indicated the need for clarification regarding scope, processes, roles and  responsibilities in assessing and potentially applying a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>. The review also  underscored the need to position the role of the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> in the overall context  of procurement risk management.</p>
            <p>From the review, it was  noted that the following elements should be addressed: </p>
            <ol class="double-space" type="i">
            <li>a  tool to assist the procurement community with <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> assessment;</li>
            <li>the  specific circumstances that will result in a note on a vendor in the Vendor  Information Management (VIM) system;</li>
            <li>the  specific <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> consequences and how the performance history in <abbr title="Vendor Information Management">VIM</abbr> will be taken  into account;</li>
            <li>a  framework for developing a regional or sector program tailored to a commodity  or commodity groupings; and</li>
            <li>the  specific steps for a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> assessment process and a rating approach.</li>
          </ol>
            <p>Key revisions and  clarifications to the 1996&nbsp;version of the VPP and PN11-R1&nbsp;are as follows:</p>
            <ol class="double-space" type="a">
            <li>The scope has now been clarified in  the introduction of the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr>.</li>
            <li>A conditional amendment, for the  purpose of the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr>, is defined as an amendment issued for operational reasons  in lieu of a termination for default because of a contractual poor performance  issue. When a contracting officer is  ready to terminate or partially terminate for default, a conditional amendment  is available as an alternative to immediate termination. If the vendor refuses  the conditional amendment, then the contract must be terminated for default and  no normal amendment can be issued.</li>
            <li>As part of the communication on the  performance issue, the contracting officer must send a copy of the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> to the  vendor.</li>
            <li>A note on  a vendor in <abbr title="Vendor Information Management">VIM</abbr> will result from contracts with terminations for default,  including partial terminations, and/or conditional amendments. (<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> reserves the right to put a note (called Other  Performance Records) in <abbr title="Vendor Information Management">VIM</abbr> for other significant issues pertaining to the  performance of a contract. However,  this is not used in the generic process that includes the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> Assessment  form.) </li>
            <li>Full or partial  terminations for default and conditional amendments trigger the mandatory  assessment process at the end of the contract to determine whether a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> will  be applied.</li>
            <li>A <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> Assessment form has been developed. This form sets out the steps for a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> assessment. These steps include rating the impact of the performance issue(s)  for the contract where there has been termination(s) for default and/or  conditional amendments. The categories of impact are: minor, medium and major.  This will become part of the vendor‚Äôs history (a note in <abbr title="Vendor Information Management">VIM</abbr>). If a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> is  applied, it will also become part of the history. The history will be included  in a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> Assessment form.</li>
            <li>There are  now only two types of <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>s for the purpose of the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr>: debarment and  conditions. Suspension is no longer available.</li>
            <li>The <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> consequences are now specified as follows. Within the last six years:
                <ol type="i" class="double-space">
                <li>for the  first <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>, there will be a 6&nbsp;month debarment or conditions.</li>
                <li>for the  second <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>, there will be a 18&nbsp;month debarment or conditions.</li>
                <li>for the  third <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>, there will be a 36&nbsp;month debarment or conditions.</li>
              </ol>
              </li>
            <li>A  framework has been developed to assist with developing a customized sector or  regional program for a commodity or commodity grouping, where applicable.</li>
            <li><abbr title="Vendor Information Management">VIM</abbr> is now  to be checked for <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>s at bid closing prior to bid evaluation as well as  before contract award and certain types of contract amendments to confirm  whether any <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>s exist. Other checks are set out in the policy.</li>
            <li>The  contents of notes and information on <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>s will be removed from <abbr title="Vendor Information Management">VIM</abbr> after six  years instead of seven. </li>
          </ol>

            <ol type="a" class="double-space">
            <li>The  contracting officer is not to evaluate bids/offers/arrangements received from a  vendor if the vendor is subject to a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> relevant to the procurement.&nbsp; (Bids include bids for contracts under supply  arrangements.) </li>

            <ol type="a" class="double-space">
            <li>A bidder/offeror/supplier, except a  bidder/offeror/supplier excluded in accordance with 1.(b) of the applicable  section&nbsp;of the <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual standard instructions, may request that the decision to reject the  bid/offer/arrangement be reviewed by the Assistant Deputy Minister,  Acquisitions Branch (ADM/AB). It is entirely in the <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr>/<abbr title="Acquisitions Branch">AB</abbr>'s discretion whether the bid evaluation and contract  award process will be held up and give further time to review the decision. </li>
            <li>A review by the <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr>/<abbr title="Acquisitions Branch">AB</abbr> will result in an investigation, and a decision.  Such a decision can have an effect beyond the particular procurement from which  the bidder/offeror/supplier has been rejected. When the decision has been made,  the bidder/offeror/supplier should be informed of the results, in writing.</li>

            <h3>8.70.5&nbsp; Amending Contracts</h3>
            <p>(<time>2011-06-29</time>)</p>
            <ol type="a" class="double-space">
            <li>Contract amendments are used to  formally delete, modify, or introduce new conditions to the original contract.  The need for an amendment may arise from continuing negotiations, changes in  requirements, or to deal with an unforeseen circumstance. When amending a  contract, Canada's  best interest should be considered. Amendments are subject to agreement by both  parties to the contract. Where the vendor is subject to a relevant <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>, the  length of the contract cannot be extended either by an amendment or through the  exercise of an option unless:
                <ol type="i" class="double-space">
                <li>there is insufficient time to  recompete; or</li>
                <li>there are other exceptional circumstances.
                    <p>These situations require <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> approval in accordance with 8.180.25&nbsp;on exceptions.</p>
                  </li>
              </ol>
              </li>
            <li>In addition  to the above regarding contract amendment in general, for the purpose of the  Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy (VPCMP), a conditional amendment  is a specific type of contract amendment. It is used for operational reasons in  lieu of a full or partial termination for default when there is a performance  issue for which the vendor is primarily responsible. When a contracting officer  is ready to terminate or partially terminate for default, a conditional  amendment is available as an alternative to immediate termination. If the  vendor refuses the conditional amendment, then the contract must be terminated  for default and no normal amendment can be issued. (See 8.180.10&nbsp;for more  information on conditional amendments and 8.180.15.1(c) for the paragraph to be  inserted in a conditional amendment. See also 8.135.15&nbsp;and Annex&nbsp;8.4&nbsp;on  termination for default.) As with terminations for default, conditional  amendments will trigger a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> Assessment process under the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr>. (See 8.180.)</li>
            <li>The amendment format will follow the  form of the original contract. The amendment should identify, by using complete  clauses, any changes, additions, conditions  or deletions.</li>
            <li>A single amendment may contain many  individual changes.</li>
            <li>To  reduce administrative costs, contracting officers and client departments should  combine as many individual changes as possible into each amendment. For  example, multiple design changes or deviations can be amended together.</li>
            <li>Amendments  should receive the same distribution as the original contract. </li>
          </ol>

            <ol type="a" class="double-space">
            <li>Amendments, which are making a  significant change, must be approved at the appropriate authority level, except  for options which are changes pre-approved or allowed for in the existing  approval(s).</li>
            <li>Legal services  must be consulted on conditional amendments before being considered. </li>

            <li>The purpose of the Vendor Performance  Corrective Measure Policy (VPCMP) is to assist the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> procurement  community in mitigating procurement risk for future contracts and improving  client service. There are a number of tools to meet this purpose. The <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> is  just one of those tools. Other tools include the Code of Conduct for  Procurement and the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions. Collectively  these tools provide a foundation on which the relationship with vendors is  established.</li>
            <li>The <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> is in  effect as of November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010. However, the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> was implemented on an  extended trial basis with no consequences for vendors from November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010&nbsp;to  June 28, 2011&nbsp;inclusive. There will be no consequences resulting from  terminations for default and/or conditional amendments that fall within the  scope of the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> and that occurred during that period. Otherwise, the provisions of the applicable  previous version remain in effect for transactions issued prior to November 4,  2010.</li>
            <li>Vendor performance issues are an  important component of procurement risk management. As shown in the Process  Chart on the Risk Management Approach to Vendor Performance (See Annex&nbsp;8.6),  those issues have to be considered at all four phases of the contract management  process.</li>
            <li>The <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> applies to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Acquisitions Branch (<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>-<abbr title="Acquisitions Branch">AB</abbr>) as a common service provider for transactions  under its authority. The scope of the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> on such transactions is clarified  below. The <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> focuses on using a vendor‚Äôs performance information from  closed contracts for:
                <ol type="i" class="double-space">
                <li><em>Rejection of offers for competitive  and non-competitive procurements</em>
                    <p>Bids/offers/arrangements  received from vendors subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure (VPCM)  will not be considered for evaluation if the terms of the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> are relevant to  that procurement. Specifically, with respect to vendors with a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>, the  following applies:</p>
                    <ol type="A" class="double-space">
                    <li>no negotiation is to be initiated and  no offer is to be accepted for a sole source contract;</li>

                    <li>offers for standing offers for goods  or services are to be rejected; and</li>
                    <li>arrangements for supply arrangements  for goods or services are to be rejected as well as bids for contracts under  supply arrangements where <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>-<abbr title="Acquisitions Branch">AB</abbr> is the contract authority.</li>

                    <p>Terminations and/or partial  terminations for default and/or conditional amendments on the following  transactions trigger a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> assessment:</p>
                    <ol type="A" class="double-space">
                    <li>sole source contracts awarded on or  after November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010;</li>
                    <li>contracts awarded pursuant to  competitive solicitations (other than (ii)(C) and (ii) (D) below) issued on or  after November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010;</li>
                    <li>call-up contracts under standing  offers awarded pursuant to a Request for&nbsp;  Standing Offers issued on or after November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010; and</li>
                    <li>contracts under supply arrangements  awarded pursuant to a Request for Supply Arrangements issued on or after  November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010&nbsp;where <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>-<abbr title="Acquisitions Branch">AB</abbr> is the contract authority.</li>
                  </ol>
                    <p>However, for the above  transactions, no consequences against vendors under the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> will be enforced  for terminations for default and/or conditional amendments that occurred from  November&nbsp;4,&nbsp;2010&nbsp;to June 28,&nbsp;2011 inclusive.</p>
                  </li>

                <li>A <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> does not affect existing  contracts.</li>
                <li>Where the vendor is subject to a  relevant <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>, the length of the contract cannot be extended either by an  amendment or through the exercise of an option unless:

                <li>No call-up contracts can be created.</li>
              </ol>
              </li>
            <li>In addition, the general information  on the nature and extent of performance problems gained during the contract and  post contract phases should be used in the other phases. In the pre-contractual  phase this information will assist in the development of the procurement risk  strategy. During that phase it will also assist with assessing the need for a  customized or tailored program for managing vendor performance on specific  commodity or commodity groupings. This information is also important in  developing not only performance criteria but also any other risk mitigation  terms for both solicitation and contract documents in the contracting phase.</li>

            <p>For the purpose of the generic process in this policy,  the following terms or expressions have the following meaning:</p>
            <ol type="a" class="double-space">
            <li><strong>Conditional amendment: </strong>refers to an amendment to a contract being made for  operational reasons in lieu of a termination for default or a partial  termination for default because of poor performance. This type of amendment may  only be considered when the contracting officer is ready to terminate (full or  partial) for default. It is an alternative to immediate termination for  default. If not accepted by the vendor, the termination for default will be  issued. </li>
            <li><strong>Poor performance</strong>:  means anything less than full performance of a contract by a vendor that  results in either a termination for default or a conditional amendment. In both  situations the vendor is primarily responsible for the poor performance. This  extends to all aspects of performance that a contracting officer and the client  want to consider and specify for evaluating the vendor's performance during the  contract. (Terminations for default also include partial terminations for  default.)</li>
            <li><strong>Vendor Performance Corrective Measure </strong>(VPCM): means a condition or limitation placed on a  vendor's ability to contract with <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> in the future on the basis of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s  assessment of the vendor‚Äôs reliability to perform a contract. In other words,  it will have an impact on the vendor being able to bid on future opportunities  or receive contracts or amendments. </li>
            <li><strong>Vendor Information Management System</strong> (<abbr title="Vendor Information Management">VIM</abbr>):&nbsp;  is a database available to the users of the Automated  Buyer Environment (ABE). It stores vendor  information including <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">VPCMP</abbr> notes and <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr>s.</li>

            <li>The contracting officer will document  in the contract file the following:

              </li>
            <li>When issuing a termination for  default or conditional amendment, the vendor is to be notified in writing of  performance issues with a copy of the notification in the contract file. The  notification must also include the following appropriate text:

            <li>The procedures on terminations for  default are set out in 8.135.15&nbsp;and Annex&nbsp;8.4. For conditional amendments see 8.70.5. Legal Services are to be consulted on both actions.</li>
            <li>If it is decided to either terminate  for default all or any part of the contract and/or issue one or more  conditional amendment(s), at the end of the contract the contracting officer  will use the form <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>‚Äì<abbr title="Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada">TPSGC</abbr> 149&nbsp;to direct the <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> co-ordinator in the Policy, Risk, Integrity and Strategic  Management (PRISM) Sector to  put a note in <abbr title="Vendor Information Management">VIM</abbr>.</li>

            <li>A contract where there has been a  termination(s) for default and/or a conditional amendment(s) triggers a  mandatory assessment to determine whether a <abbr title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure">VPCM</abbr> is to be applied.
