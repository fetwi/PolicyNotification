            <p>1. A new section,&nbsp;13.1 of the Act, applies to employers who, on or after October&nbsp;31,&nbsp;1995, begin to provide building services (in the province of Ontario) such as cleaning, catering or security at the premises, replacing another employer who was providing those services.</p>
<p>2. These are the same services which were covered by Part&nbsp;XIII.2 of the Act which is repealed effective October&nbsp;31,&nbsp;1995.</p>
<p>3. Where a successor employer hires an employee of the previous employer who provided these services at the premises, the employee will be deemed to have continuous services, and all employment with previous employers (under Bill&nbsp;40 from and after June&nbsp;4,&nbsp;1992) shall be counted for the purposes of <acronym title="Employment Standards Act">ESA</acronym> entitlements for public holidays, vacation, pregnancy and parental leave, and termination and severance pay.</p>
<p>4. If the successor employer does not hire an employee of the previous employer who provided services at the premises, the successor employer must comply with Part&nbsp;XIV of the Act (termination and severance provisions), subject to the exemptions in <em>Ontario Regulation&nbsp;138/96</em>.</p>
<p>5. If the successor employer provides an offer of reasonable work which is refused by an employee of the previous employer, the successor employer does not have to comply with Part&nbsp;XIV of the Act. An employee's terms and conditions of employment with the previous employer is considered when determining the reasonableness of an offer.</p>
<p>6. If the successor employer hires an employee of the previous employer, the previous employer shall pay the employee any accrued vacation pay.</p>
<p>7. Upon request by the building owner or manager, an employer providing the specified services shall provide information as set out in the Ontario Regulation&nbsp;138/96.</p>
<p>8. Upon request, the building owner or manager shall provide this information to prospective bidders, or to a successor employer.</p>
<p>9. Such information shall be used only for the purpose of complying with the Act and shall not be disclosed except as authorized by the Act.</p>
<p>10. The text of the Ontario Regulation was published in the Ontario Gazette, dated April&nbsp;20,&nbsp;1996, reference number&nbsp;138/96.</p>
