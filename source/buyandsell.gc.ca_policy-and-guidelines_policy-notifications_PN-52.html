            <p>Due to experience gained since the intellectual property (IP) materials in the May 25, 2001, SACC   release were finalized, the following terms should be used.</p>
<p>The revisions to K3025D, K3320D and K3410D simply replace those in the SACC release. <strong>Remarks are unchanged</strong>. The clauses relating to DSS-MAS 9601-6, 9601-7 and 9624 amend these documents. These  terms will be incorporated in the next available SACC release.</p>
<p>Changes affect DSS-MAS 9601-6, 9601-7, 9624, K3025D, K3320D and K3410D.</p>
<p>The purpose of the changes is to:</p>
<p>1) deal with source code for COTS software separately from other types of Background Information to better reflect industry standards of access to source code;</p>
<p>2) narrow somewhat the broad scope of the Background Information licenses in DSS-MAS 9601-6 and  DSS-MAS 9601-7, to better reflect the fact that these terms will most often be used in contracts that are essentially for modified off-the-shelf products rather than for research and development;</p>
<p>3) enhance the Crown's ability to compete the maintenance, repair and overhaul of such a product; and</p>
<p>4) make some editorial changes that had been missed previously.</p>
