<h2 id="Purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification (PN)-152 is to inform Government of Canada contracting authorities of new vaccination requirements for supplier personnel who access Government of Canada workplaces.</p>
<p>Contracting authorities should consult this Policy Notification regularly to ensure they are apprised of any updates, as it is subject to change.</p>
<h2 id="EffectiveDate">Effective date </h2>
<p>This Policy Notification is effective immediately and immediate action must therefore be taken to ensure the requirements of the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel are implemented in affected solicitations and contracts. The vaccination requirements for supplier personnel enter into effect on November 15, 2021.</p>
<p>Related changes to the Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) Supply Manual (SM), Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual, and Standard Procurement Templates have been made to the respective documents.</p>
<h2 id="Background">Background</h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on the health of Canadians. COVID-19 vaccines are a critical tool that reduce the risk of COVID-19 and protect broader public health.</p>
<p>As a responsible employer, the Government of Canada is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees. On October 6, 2021, the Government of Canada announced its <a rel="external" href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32694">Policy on COVID-19 Vaccination for the Core Public Administration Including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a>.</p>
<p>In alignment with this important measure, all supplier personnel (including subcontractor personnel) who access federal government workplaces will also be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. This requirement will enter into effect on November 15, 2021.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/notice-to-federal-contractors">notice to federal contractors</a> informing them of this vaccination requirement was published on BuyandSell.gc.ca on October 6, 2021. The information contained in this Policy Notification will assist contracting authorities in implementing the vaccination requirement in affected solicitations and contracts.</p>
<h2 id="Scope">Scope</h2>
<p>To align with the Policy on COVID-19 Vaccination for the Core Public Administration including the <abbr title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">RCMP</abbr>, the vaccination requirements of the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel <strong>applies to all new and existing Government of Canada contracts that involve services</strong> (including goods contracts that have a services component and construction services) <strong>where, in order to perform the work, supplier personnel access Government of Canada workplaces</strong> (<abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr>, places of work owned or operated by the Government of Canada) <strong>where they may come into contact with public servants</strong>. The vaccination requirements of this Policy also apply to supplier personnel who access Government of Canada workplaces where they may come into contact with public servants for the purpose of bidders‚Äô conferences or site visits.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this Policy Notification, the term ‚Äòsupplier‚Äô includes bidders, contractors, offerors, and suppliers (in the context of Supply Arrangements). ‚ÄòPersonnel‚Äô means all persons employed by the supplier or conducting work for or on behalf of the supplier, including but not limited to, subcontractors, subcontractors‚Äô employees, consultants and agents.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel does not apply to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>contracts where the only services component is delivery;</li>
    <li>contracts where services are solely performed in non-Government of Canada workplaces;</li>
    <li>contracts that are solely for the provision of goods (<abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr> no services components); or</li>
    <li>situations where public servants must enter contractor facilities (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr>, to conduct compliance audits or security verifications).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Duration">Duration</h2>
<p>In line with the Policy on COVID-19 Vaccination for the Core Public Administration including the <abbr title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">RCMP</abbr>, the vaccination requirements of the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel will be time-limited to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be reassessed at a minimum every six months, or as prescribed by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.</p>
<p>Once the Policy on COVID-19 Vaccination for the Core Public Administration including the <abbr title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">RCMP</abbr> no longer applies, the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel will also be rescinded. When that occurs, contracting authorities will no longer be required to include the requirements and certifications relating to COVID-19 vaccinations in solicitation documents and contracts. Ongoing contracts will not require amendment; however, the vaccination requirement will no longer be enforced. Contracting authorities will receive further information and guidance when vaccination requirements for supplier personnel are no longer required.</p>
<h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>To implement the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel in solicitations and contracts where the work involves supplier personnel accessing Government of Canada workplaces where they may come into contact with public servants, departments and agencies must undertake the steps described below. Contracting authorities may need to communicate with technical authorities to determine which contracts and solicitations are in scope of this Policy.</p>
<h3 id="NewAndActiveSolicitations">New and active solicitations</h3>
<p>When preparing solicitation documents and contracts for new requirements where supplier personnel will or might access Government of Canada workplaces where they may come into contact with public servants, contracting authorities must ensure that clause 2035 05 (5) or clause 2040 05 (5) are incorporated either by reference or in full. This should be achieved automatically if contracting authorities are using <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/2035/active">2035: General Conditions - Higher Complexity ‚Äì Services</a> or <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/2040/active">2040: General Conditions - Research and Development</a>.</p>
<p>If <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clauses 2035 or 2040 are <strong>not</strong> being utilized, contracting authorities are required to include the new <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/4/4013/active">4013 - Compliance with on-site measures, standing orders, policies, and rules</a> in the solicitation and the resulting contract.</p>
<p>In addition to clause 2035, 2040, or 4013, contracting authorities are required to include the following in solicitation documents that are subject to the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel:</p>
<ul>
    <li>New <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/A/A3080T/active">A3080T: COVID-19 vaccination requiremen</a>t;</li>
    <li>New <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/A/A3081T/active">A3081T: COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification</a>;</li>
    <li>If equivalent language is not already included in the solicitation, clause <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/A/A3015T/active">A3015T: Certifications - Bid</a>; and</li>
    <li>If a ‚ÄòSuspension of the work‚Äô clause is not already included in the general conditions, new <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/4/4014/active">4014: Suspension of the work</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For active procurements, the solicitation documents <strong>must be amended</strong> before the closing date to include the above clauses. This may require providing bidders with additional time in order to complete their bids.</p>
<p>Finally, if equivalent language is not already included, <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/A/A3015C/active">A3015C: Certifications - Contract</a> must be included in all new contracts that fall under the scope of the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel. Such a clause will incorporate the conditions of the COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification that was submitted as part of the bid by reference into the contract, therefore making the certification form part of the legally binding agreement between Canada and the contractor.</p>
<p>If the bidder advises the contracting authority that there are personnel who are unable to be vaccinated, refer to the <a href="#DutyToAccommodate">Duty to accommodate</a> section below. If the bidder advises the contracting authority that there are personnel who are only partially vaccinated, refer to the <a href="#PartiallyVaccinatedSupplierPersonnel">Partially vaccinated supplier personnel</a> section. If the bidder does not complete and submit the Certification Form as part of the bid, refer to the <a href="#NonCompliance">Non-compliance</a> section. The Certification Form includes an optional section that is for data purposes only ‚Äì bidders are not required to fill in this optional section. Filling in the optional section is also not a substitute for completing the mandatory part of the certification.</p>
<p>For solicitations subject to this Policy that did not include the vaccination requirement that are in the bid evaluation stage, or are in the process of being awarded, refer to the section below.</p>
<h3 id="ExistingContracts">Existing contracts</h3>
<p>To implement the vaccination requirement in existing contracts that fall within the scope of the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel, a version of the ‚ÄòTemplate Letter to Contractors‚Äô (<a href="#AnnexA">Annex A</a>) must be completed and sent to contractors along with a ‚ÄòCOVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification Form‚Äô for existing contracts (<a href="#AnnexB">Annex B</a> or <a href="#AnnexI">Annex I</a>). For flexibility, the Certification Form provided in these Annexes have a single contract version and multi-contract version, either of which can be used, as appropriate. </p>
<p>The contractor must then complete the Certification Form and return it to the responsible department or agency. Contractors must complete the Certification Form at least once for each department or agency that they have an active contract with and may therefore receive the letter and be required to complete the Certification Form multiple times. It is recommended that departments and agencies make efforts to reduce the number of times a single contractor is contacted for a certification by their department or agency <abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr>, at team level, coordinated with colleagues to avoid sending multiple emails to the same supplier, <abbr title="et cetera">etc</abbr>.).</p>
<p>Completed Certification Forms are required to be returned to departments and agencies by November 12, 2021. If contractors have not returned their completed Certification Form(s) by November 1, 2021, then ‚ÄòFollow-Up Letter‚Äô (<a href="#AnnexC">Annex C</a>) should be sent to the contractor with the Certification Form.</p>
<p><strong>PWGSC contracting authorities must refer to <a href="#AnnexD">Annex D</a> to review the way in which the certification process for existing contracts will be implemented at <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.</strong></p>
<p>The process described above also applies to in-scope solicitations that did not include the vaccination requirement that are in the bid evaluation stage, or are in the process of being awarded. However, the date(s) for the letters and certification may need to be adjusted based on the stage of the procurement process. In all cases, the vaccination requirement enters into force on November 15, 2021. For solicitations that did not include the vaccination requirement that are in the bid evaluation stage, or are in the process of being awarded, the single contract version of the Certification Form should be utilized. </p>
<p>If the contractor advises that there are contractor or subcontractor personnel who are unable to be vaccinated, refer to the <a href="#DutyToAccommodate">Duty to accommodate</a> section below. If the bidder advises the contracting authority that there are personnel who are only partially vaccinated, refer to the <a href="#PartiallyVaccinatedSupplierPersonnel">Partially vaccinated supplier personnel</a> section. If the contractor does not complete and return the Certification Form by November 12, 2021, or if the contractor is unwilling or fails to complete the certification, refer to the <a href="#NonCompliance">Non-compliance</a> section. The Certification Form includes an optional section that is for data purposes only ‚Äì bidders are not required to fill in this optional section. Filling in the optional section is also not a substitute for completing the mandatory part of the certification.</p>
<p>Departments and agencies should keep all communications and the completed Certification Form on file (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr>, in the procurement file, in a centralized location or database, <abbr title="et cetera">etc</abbr>.). Additionally, once the appropriate completed Certification Form has been received, the contracting authority must inform the relevant business owner(s) or technical authority(s) as defined in the contract, if applicable.</p>
<h3 id="SupplyArrangements">Supply Arrangements</h3>
<p>Contracting authorities must include new <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/S/S3037T/active">S3037T: Applicability of COVID-19 vaccination requirements to individual solicitations</a> in Requests for Supply Arrangements (RFSAs) that are new or are in the process of being refreshed and that could lead to individual solicitations that are in-scope of the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel. They must also include <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/4/4013/active">4013: Compliance with on-site measures, standing orders, policies, and rules</a>, and, if a ‚ÄòSuspension of the work‚Äô clause is not already included in the general conditions that will be used, <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clause <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/4/4014/active">4014: Suspension of the work</a> as supplemental general conditions that will apply to the resulting contract.</p>
<p>Active <abbr title="Requests for Supply Arrangements">RFSAs</abbr> do not require amendment ‚Äì the vaccination requirement will be implemented at the individual solicitation stage or contract stage only.</p>
<p>For new individual solicitations under Supply Arrangements (SAs) and for individual solicitations under <abbr title="Supply Arrangements">SAs</abbr> that are in the process of being competed that are in-scope of this Policy, contracting authorities should follow the process for <a href="#NewAndActiveSolicitations">New and active solicitations</a>. For active individual solicitations, this may require providing bidders with additional time in order to complete their bid.</p>
<p>For in-scope individual contracts under <abbr title="Supply Arrangements">SAs</abbr>, or for in-scope solicitations under <abbr title="Supply Arrangements">SAs</abbr> that are in the bid evaluation or award stage, contracting authorities should follow the process for <a href="#ExistingContracts">Existing contracts</a>.</p>
<h3 id="StandingOffers">Standing Offers</h3>
<p>In new Requests for Standing Offers (RFSOs) and in <abbr title="Requests for Standing Offers">RFSOs</abbr> in the process of being refreshed that are in-scope of the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel, contracting authorities should follow the process for <a href="#NewAndActiveSolicitations">New and active solicitations</a>. However, for the clauses, contracting authorities should instead use: </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://content.buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/M/M3080T/active">M3080T: COVID-19 vaccination requirements for Standing Offers</a>;</li>

    <li>If equivalent language is not already included in the solicitation, clauses <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/M/M3015T/active">M3015T: Certification ‚Äì Standing Offers</a> and <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/M/M3015C/active">M3015C: Compliance with Certification ‚Äì Standing Offers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Active Standing Offers (SOs) do not require amendment ‚Äì the vaccination requirement will be implemented at the call-up stage.</p>
<p>For new in-scope call-ups under <abbr title="Standing Offers">SOs</abbr> that <strong>do not</strong> include the vaccination requirement, and for in-scope call-ups that are in the process of being delivered, contracting authorities should follow the process used for <a href="#ExistingContracts">Existing contracts</a>.</p>
<p>For in-scope call-ups under <abbr title="Standing Offers">SOs</abbr> where the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> included the vaccination requirement, no action is necessary at the call-up stage, as the vaccination certification would have been completed at the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offer">RFSO</abbr> stage.</p>
<h3 id="BiddersConferencesAndSiteVisits">Bidders‚Äô conferences and site visits </h3>
<p>If bidders‚Äô conferences or site visits will occur at Government of Canada workplaces where bidder/offeror/supplier representative(s) may come into contact with public servants, then the vaccination requirements of the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel will apply to those representatives. In such cases, bidder/offeror/supplier representatives will be required to submit a separate certification indicating that they meet the requirements of the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel to the contracting authority in advance of the conference or site visit. Contracting authorities should keep these completed certifications in the procurement file. Additionally, once the completed certification has been received, contracting authority must inform the business owner(s) or technical authority(s) as defined in the resulting contract, if applicable. <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clauses relating to bidders‚Äô conferences and site visits have been amended to include this new requirement.</p>
<h3 id="DutyToAccommodate">Duty to accommodate </h3>
<p>Some supplier personnel may not be able to be vaccinated due to a certified medical contraindication, religion or other prohibited grounds of discrimination under the <a rel="external" href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/"><cite>Canadian Human Rights Act</cite></a>.</p>
<p>In such cases, the technical authority will consider a supplier's request(s) to use accommodation and mitigation measures in accordance with the <cite>Canadian Human Rights Act</cite>, as applicable. Suppliers are expected to inform the responsible contracting authority as soon as possible of the number of such personnel, the impacted work locations, and the steps the supplier proposes to undertake to mitigate any associated risks. Accommodation and mitigation measures are subject to approval by the technical authority and must be adequate to ensure the health and safety of public servants. The contracting authority must forward any requests for accommodation and mitigation measures to the technical authority as soon as possible to determine if the proposed measures are acceptable.</p>
<p>Acceptable accommodation and mitigation measures could be as follows:</p>

    <li>Personnel who are unable to be vaccinated will telework (if possible and subject to approval by the technical authority); or</li>
    <li>Personnel who are unable to be vaccinated or telework will undergo COVID-19 regular mandatory testing and report their results to their employer. If the test is positive, the personnel will not access the Government of Canada workplace, or, if already at the workplace, will leave immediately. The supplier will retain a record of the test results. In addition to the regular mandatory testing, the personnel must follow local public health guidelines and any other required COVID-19 preventative measures in the workplace (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr>, masks, physical distancing, as required).</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppliers are responsible for providing the resources and covering the costs of the accommodation and mitigation measures for their personnel.</p>
<p>If neither of the above accommodation or mitigation measures can be utilized, contracting authorities should email <a rel="external" href="mailto:TPSGC.PACertificatsVaccins-APVaccinesCertificates.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca">TPSGC.PACertificatsVaccins-APVaccinesCertificates.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca</a> for further guidance. Please include in the email the reason(s) why the supplier is unable to follow either of the above mitigation measures.</p>
<p>Under this Policy, accommodation and mitigation measures are not available to supplier personnel who are unwilling to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Suppliers should not share any personal information, such as any specifics about medical contraindications or about the applicable prohibited grounds of discrimination under the <cite>Canadian Human Rights Act</cite>, unless specifically requested. Contracting and technical authorities are not responsible for reviewing or approving the exemptions themselves ‚Äì that responsibility remains with the supplier only. The technical authority only needs to approve the mitigation measures as sufficient to ensure the health and safety of the public servants at the workplace pursuant to the above guidance.</p>
<h3 id="PartiallyVaccinatedSupplierPersonnel">Partially vaccinated supplier personnel</h3>
<p>In alignment with the Policy on COVID-19 Vaccination for the Core Public Administration Including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, supplier personnel who are partially vaccinated may continue to access Government of Canada workplaces to perform contracted work, subject to approved temporary measures until they can become fully vaccinated. <strong>These temporary measures are only to be used for a maximum 10-week period that begins on the date the supplier personnel received their first dose</strong>. By the end of the 10-week period, the temporary measures for the partially vaccinated personnel in question may no longer be used and the supplier personnel should be:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>fully vaccinated; or</li>
    <li>if it became known during the 10-week period that the supplier personnel is unable to become fully vaccinated due to a certified medical contraindication, religion or other prohibited grounds of discrimination under the <cite>Canadian Human Rights Act</cite>, subject to mitigation measures that have been presented to and approved by Canada.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the 10-week period concludes with the supplier personnel not fully vaccinated or subject to mitigation measures as per the above, the temporary measures will no longer be permitted and the partially vaccinated supplier personnel in question will no longer be permitted to access Government of Canada workplaces where they may come into contact with public servants until such time that they become fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Given the above, there may be partially vaccinated supplier personnel subject to temporary measures throughout the entire application period of the COVID-19 Vaccination Policy for Supplier Personnel; <strong>however, each partially vaccinated person only has a maximum 10 week period to become fully vaccinated</strong>. This is designed to assist suppliers who bring on new personnel during the contract period who may not yet be fully vaccinated, and therefore applies to all types of contracts (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr> new solicitations, existing contracts, etc.).</p>
<p>During the 10-week period, subject to the approval of the technical authority, partially vaccinated supplier personnel may be subject to any of the following temporary measures at the supplier‚Äôs expense:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Supplier personnel who are partially vaccinated will telework (if possible);</li>
    <li>Supplier personnel who are partially vaccinated and unable to telework will undergo COVID-19 regular mandatory testing and report their results to their employer. If the test is positive, the supplier personnel will not access the Government of Canada workplace, or, if already at the workplace, will leave immediately. The supplier will retain a record of the test results. In addition to the regular mandatory testing, the supplier personnel must follow local public health guidelines and any other required COVID-19 preventative measures in the workplace (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr>, masks, physical distancing, as required); or</li>
    <li>If neither of the above temporary measures can be utilized, contracting authorities should work with the technical authority and the supplier to determine if there are other temporary measures that would ensure the health and safety of public servants at the workplace, and if so, may apply those measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppliers are expected to inform the responsible contracting authority as soon as possible of the number of partially vaccinated personnel, the impacted work locations, and the temporary measures the supplier proposes to undertake to mitigate any associated risks. Temporary measures are subject to approval by the technical authority and must be adequate to ensure the health and safety of public servants. The contracting authority must forward any requests for temporary measures to the technical authority as soon as possible to determine if the proposed measures are acceptable. Technical authorities must consider these measures and approve them if they are adequate to ensure the health and safety of public servants.</p>
<p>As indicated above, if, after the 10 week period, the supplier personnel in question has not become fully vaccinated (or if unable to become fully vaccinated, subject to approved mitigation measures), temporary measures will no longer be permitted and partially vaccinated supplier personnel will no longer be permitted to access Government of Canada workplaces where they may come into contact with public servants until such a time that they become fully vaccinated. Suppliers who continue to provide a partially vaccinated resource after the 10 week period (excluding those who are partially vaccinated but are unable to become fully vaccinated and are subject to approved mitigation measures, as described above) will have failed to comply with the COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification of this Policy and may be subject to non-compliance measures as outlined below.</p>
<p>Certification forms that account for partially vaccinated personnel can be found in <a href="#AnnexI">Annex I</a>.</p>
<h3 id="VerificationOfVaccinationCertifications">Verification of vaccination certifications and proof of vaccination</h3>
<p>Certifications provided to Canada are subject to verification at all times, which includes Canada reserving the right to request proof of vaccination from supplier personnel when accessing a federal government workplace. </p>
<p>Senior designated officials (SDO) for the management of procurement are responsible for implementing a control framework to ensure compliance with the Policy. Verifying supplier compliance with the Policy of contracts conducted by common service providers (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr> <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>/<abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>) rests with the <abbr title="Senior designated officials">SDO</abbr> of the client department or agency.</p>
<p>The control framework is a set of measures and activities to ensure the compliance of the process implemented by the department to follow the Policy requirements. The control framework should be developed in consultation with departmental occupational health and safety, internal control, security, and privacy officials, as well as any other relevant officials. Departments must continue to respect information management protocols and retention guidelines, and act in accordance with the <cite>Privacy Act</cite>. It is recommended that departmental privacy officials or legal services be consulted for questions on the privacy and security consideration related to the information collected as part of the control framework.</p>
<h3 id="NonCompliance">Non-compliance </h3>
<p>Where suppliers are unwilling or fail to provide a duly completed COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification, where a COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification has been determined to be untrue, or, where a contractor fails to comply with the COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification or this Policy, the following applies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For new and active solicitations:</strong> completing and providing the COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification is a mandatory requirement of the bid. If the bidder was unwilling or fails to provide the certification, then the bid is found to be non-responsive, and the bidder is ineligible for contract award.</li>
    <li><strong>For solicitations that did not include a vaccination requirement and are in the bid evaluation or contract award stage:</strong> if the winning bidder is unwilling or fails to provide the COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification, contracting authorities should not award the contract and should contact the business owner/technical authority and their Legal Services for options. Re-competing the requirement may be necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>For existing contracts:</strong> if the contractor is unwilling or fails to provide the COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification by November 12, 2021, or if it is subsequently discovered and verified that the certification they provided is untrue or where a contractor fails to comply with the COVID-19 Vaccination Requirement Certification or this Policy, then termination of the contract must be considered. In this scenario, contracting authorities must take the following escalating steps until the issue is resolved:
        <ol>
            <li>Engage with the contractor to determine the cause for their non-compliance and to determine if the contractor can and will take immediate steps to comply with the vaccination requirement. Before proceeding to step 2, contracting authorities must discuss with the business owner/technical authority, Legal Services (if necessary), and take into account the operational requirement, to determine if other options exist. For example, if a contractor is unable to provide the certification solely due to a subcontractor that is not willing to comply, an alternative option could include, but is not limited to, providing the contractor a reasonable period of time to locate a different subcontractor who is willing to comply with the vaccination requirement, <abbr title="et cetera">etc</abbr>.</li>
            <li>Engage with the business owner/technical authority about issuing a stop work order (if permitted under the terms and conditions of the contract) and/or pursuing termination of the contract.</li>
            <li>If permitted under the terms and conditions of the contract, issue a stop work order (or partial stop work order), to be effective on November 15, 2021 or, if after November 15, 2021, to be effective immediately. The stop work order will protect health and safety by preventing unvaccinated personnel from accessing Government of Canada workplaces where they may come into contact with public servants for work under the contract until such time that the contract can be terminated or until such time that the contractor agrees to comply with the vaccination requirement. If necessary, contact Legal Services for guidance on the stop work order.</li>
            <li>If necessary, contact Legal Services for guidance on how to terminate the contract (in whole or in part).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Consult <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/8/135">section 8.135</a> of the Supply Manual for further information on stop work orders and terminations.</p>
<h2 id="Reporting">Reporting</h2>
<p>Departments and agencies will be responsible for reporting on COVID-19 vaccination requirements for supplier personnel. While the reporting template is still being finalized, it is likely to require reporting on, at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The number of existing contracts that have been impacted by the vaccination requirement;</li>
    <li>The number of completed vaccination certifications received from current contractors;</li>
    <li>The number of refusals by current contractors to complete the vaccination certification;</li>
    <li>The number of active solicitations that include the vaccination requirement; and</li>

<p>Dear <kbd><em>[Insert contractor representative‚Äôs name]</em></kbd>,</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have an unprecedented impact on the health of Canadians. COVID-19 vaccines are a critical tool that reduce the risk of COVID-19 and protect broader public health.</p>
<p>As a responsible employer, the Government of Canada is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees. On October 6, 2021, the Government of Canada announced its <a rel="external" href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32694">Policy on COVID-19 Vaccination for the Core Public Administration Including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In alignment with this important measure, all contractor personnel who access federal government workplaces where they may come into contact with public servants will also be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. This requirement will enter in effect on November 15, 2021.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please note that this is a mandatory requirement and that personnel that are unwilling to be vaccinated will not be permitted to work at federal government workplaces where they may come into contact with public servants, as of November 15, 2021. Government of Canada contracting authorities will be pursuing means to ensure compliance, up to and including contract terminations with contractors who do not comply with this requirement.</strong></p>
<p><kbd><em><strong>[Optional:</strong></em></kbd></p>
<p><kbd><em><strong>If expecting contractors to initially self-identify in-scope contracts, add:</strong></em></kbd></p>
<p><strong>If any of your contracts involve services where, in order to perform the work, your personnel or your subcontractors‚Äô personnel (if applicable) access Government of Canada workplaces where they may come into contact with public servants, then your business must certify that you will comply with the vaccination requirement on these contracts.</strong> This includes, for example, goods contracts that have a services component.</p>
<p>The vaccination requirement does not apply to contracts such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>contracts where the only services component is delivery;</li>
    <li>contracts where services are solely performed in non-Government of Canada workplaces; or</li>
    <li>contracts that are solely for the provision of goods. </li>
</ul>
<p>You are <strong>not required</strong> to submit a vaccination certification with respect to these types of contracts.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The number of such unvaccinated personnel;</li>
    <li>The impacted work locations; and </li>
    <li>The steps you propose to undertake to mitigate any associated risks (such as regular rapid testing).</li>
