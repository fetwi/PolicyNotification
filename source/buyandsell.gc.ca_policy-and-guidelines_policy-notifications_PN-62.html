            <p>An agreement-in-principle was reached between officials of the Department of National Defence (DND) and Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) to use the Incoterm "FCA Free Carrier (... named place)", whenever possible, rather than Free on Board (FOB) Plant for all DND sole source contracts, and all Repair and Overhaul (R&amp;O) contracts where transportation is not part of the competitive bid. The current Incoterms are Incoterms 2000, hereinafter referred to as FCA. It was agreed that DND will manage the inbound logistics for these contracts by being responsible for the transportation arrangements and associated risks, becoming the importer of record, and being able to invoke Remission Orders. For United States (U.S.) Foreign Military Sales contracts only (not all U.S. contracts) FOB Plant will continue to be used and DND will manage the inbound logistic on those contracts as well.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, all new DND requisitions for DND sole source contracts, and all Repair and Overhaul (R&amp;O) contracts where transportation is not part of the competitive bid<strong>, </strong>will contain FCA procedures and clauses.</p>
<p>Current DND sole source contracts with a delivery date well into 2003 or later should be examined to see whether or not they should be amended to include the new Incoterms 2000 clauses. The decision to amend an existing contract should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis and with consultation from DND. There may be a requirement for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> to revalidate administrative and management fees and overhead in those contracts where DND is now taking on the transportation function and associated risks.</p>
<p>The Automated Buyer Environment (ABE) system will not be updated at this time. For all FCA requirements, under the field "F.O.B.", the term "See Herein" should be used (not the words "plant", "common carrier" or "destination") and the proper FCA clauses placed inside the bid solicitation/contract document(s).</p>
<p>The FCA procedures and their related clauses and other miscellaneous shipping instructions clauses are provided at Annexes A, B and C, respectively, and will be incorporated into the next Supply Manual and Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions Manual amendments, scheduled for release in December 2003.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Approximately one year ago, sectors and regions, started receiving requisitions from DND which requested that sole source contracts and R&amp;O contracts be awarded on a FCA basis. This term is somewhat equivalent to FOB Plant, which is not an Incoterm and therefore not precise.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> has traditionally used the term FOB Plant; however, this term is no longer in line with common industry practice. Incoterms are increasingly used for both foreign and domestic shipments.</em></p>
<p>Incoterms are internationally recognized Terms of Sale established by a 68-country membership of International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). They were created in 1936 as an attempt to standardize Trade Terms as an aide to simplify international transactions. Incoterms are periodically updated, most recently January 1, 2000, and are defined on the ICC Website: <a rel="external" href="http://www.iccwbo.org/index_incoterms.asp">http://www.iccwbo.org/index_incoterms.asp</a>. Incoterms are copyright protected but <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> has been given permission by the ICC to link to their Website.</p>
<p>Directorates may find it useful to purchase their own copy of the Incoterms manual in order to familiarize themselves with the specific obligations of the buyer and seller. Details on how to order the Manual can be found on the ICC Website.</p>
<h3>Rationale for the change</h3>
<p>DND explained that they were experiencing numerous problems as a result of the FOB terminology (both FOB Plant and FOB Destination) and suggested that <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> consider the use of FCA whenever possible to clearly delineate the Buyer and Seller's responsibilities. The types of problems being experienced by DND include the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>suppliers shipping goods COLLECT when they are contractually obliged to deliver the goods within their price;</li>
<li>shipments to multiple consignees being delivered to the closest Canadian Forces (FC) location and left to DND to redistribute;</li>
<li>shipments being turned away from the CF depots because they are arriving unforecasted/ unplanned for receipt;</li>
<li>additional sufferance warehouse charges for shipments which could not be received when unforecasted delivery could not be accommodated; and,</li>
<li>duplication of billings and payments.</li>
</ol>
<p>DND believes these problems will be reduced or eliminated by using FCA and DND inbound transportation procedures whenever possible. These changes were presented by the DND Transportation Management Directorate at a Working Group Meeting held on April 25, 2002, and subsequently tabled at the Acquisition Policy Council on April 30, 2002.</p>

<h3>Annex A<br>
					CHANGES TO SUPPLY MANUAL</h3>
<h4>Chapter 6: Process</h4>
<p><strong>Transportation Charges</strong></p>
<p>6E.621 (10/12/01) No changes.</p>
<p>6E.622 (xx/xx/xx) FCA Free Carrier (... named place) Incoterms 2000 is to be used for all Department of National Defence (DND) sole source contracts, and all Repair and Overhaul (R&amp;O) contracts where transportation is not part of the competitive bid. DND will manage the inbound logistics (coordinate, arrange and pay for all inbound transportation) for these contracts. For United States (U.S.) Foreign Military Sales contracts only (not all U.S. contracts) FOB Plant will continue to be used and DND will manage the inbound logistic on those contracts as well.</p>
<p>The contractor is to deliver these goods FCA. For these contracts the named place shall always be the contractor's facility, unless otherwise directed by DND. The contracting officer shall include in the solicitation document and the contract one of the following SACC Manual transportation clauses: D0035D, D0037D, or D0038D. These clauses direct the contractor to obtain shipping instructions from DND and how to do so. Contractors may also contact DND Headquarters at 613-996-0454 or 613-995-6958 should they have any transportation queries.</p>
<h4>Chapter 8 - ACAN/Negotiated Procurement</h4>
<p><strong>DND Requirements</strong></p>
<p>8.025 (xx/xx/xx) Department of National Defence (DND) requirements which are successfully processed through the use of an ACAN can be awarded on a FCA Free Carrier (... named place) Incoterms 2000 basis. If the ACAN is successfully challenged and gives way to an open competitive process, the contracting officer shall consider what alternatives to use in lieu of FCA for the bid solicitation and resultant contract.</p>
<h4>Chapter 12 - Glossary</h4>
<p><strong>carrier</strong></p>
<p>Any person who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure the performance of transport by rail, road, air, sea, inland waterway or by a combination of such modes. (xx/xx/xx) <strong><em>(transporteur)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>FCA (Free Carrier {...named place})</strong></p>
<p>The book containing the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) official rules for the interpretation of trade terms is entitled 'Incoterms 2000' and a summary for the description of FCA may be found on the ICC Website at: <a rel="external" href="http://www.iccwbo.org/index_incoterms.asp">http://www.iccwbo.org/index_incoterms.asp</a>. The responsible obligations of the Buyer and Seller cannot be found on the ICC Website, that information may only be found in the Incoterms 2000 book. (xx/xx/xx) <strong><em>(franco transporteur {... lieu convenu})</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>FOB (Free on Board)</strong></p>
<p>A mercantile term used extensively in both domestic and international trade.</p>
<p>1. As a domestic trade term, used in both Canada and the United States, FOB ordinarily determines the place where the seller effects delivery of the goods, where title and risk of loss will pass and whether the seller or the buyer is required to pay freight charges (e.g. FOB New York) unless otherwise specified in the contract. Specific application of the term FOB either with reference to transfer of title, risk, or burden of freight charges, may vary according to applicable law, custom and usage or agreement of the parties concerned.</p>
<p>2. As an Incoterm, FOB is defined by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and can only be used for shipments by seagoing vessels. (Note: there are thirteen Incoterms, six of which can only be used for shipments by seagoing vessel.) The ICC Website can be accessed at: <a rel="external" href="http://www.iccwbo.org/index_incoterms.asp">http://www.iccwbo.org/index_incoterms.asp</a>. The contractual rights and obligations of this and similar mercantile terms are used in international commerce. (xx/xx/xx) <strong>(FOB - franco bord)</strong></p>
<p><strong>inbound logistics</strong></p>
<p>The definition of inbound logistics is a matter of perspective. Shipments to Canadian Forces from Repair and Overhaul facilities and shipments off new acquisitions are considered inbound. Inbound logistics does not have an agreed-upon definition in the industry. A shipment is inbound to the receiver; conversely, shipments that are sent out - as a raw materiel supplier, manufacturer or vendor might do - are outbound from the sender. For inbound logistics planning, the focus of transportation management is on planning the receipt of the shipment. The definition of inbound logistics, then is related not only to the controller of the shipment process, but also who takes ownership of the goods shipped. (xx/xx/xx) <strong><em>(logistique interne)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Incoterms</strong></p>
<p>Incoterms are defined on the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Website at <a rel="external" href="http://www.iccwbo.org/index_incoterms.asp">http://www.iccwbo.org/index_incoterms.asp</a>. Incoterms are standard trade definitions most commonly used in international sales contracts. They are protected by ICC copyright. (xx/xx/xx) <strong>(<em>Incoterms</em>)</strong></p>
