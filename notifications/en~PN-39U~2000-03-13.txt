<p>A great deal of attention has be given to sole-sourcing within government. The Standing Committee of Public Accounts devoted a considerable amount of time to this issue and raised several concerns. More recently, the Auditor General issued in November, 1999 a second report on the sole-sourcing of service contracts. As a result, the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> ACAN policy has been reviewed.</p>
<p>A general review of the ACAN policy is underway which will result in a number of changes in the near future. However, until such time as the review is completed, the following are reminders:</p>
<p>1. Procurement personnel are encouraged to include sufficient information in ACANs to allow potential suppliers to make an informed decision as to their ability to fulfill the requirement. Such information should include the description and estimated value of the requirement, (or rough order of magnitude, if a more exact figure will impact on negotiations with the proposed contractor).</p>
<p>2. Procurement personnel must post ACANs for a full 15 calendar days (as per PN-39).</p>
<p>3. As indicated in TBS Contracting Policy Notice 1999-3, "The notice should not discourage possible challengers. For example, one should not say, "this is not a competitive solicitation..." or words to that effect." Therefore, the statement <strong>THIS IS NOT A COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION</strong> must be removed whenever the Sample ACAN provided at Annex 8.1 of the Supply Manual is used, pending the next amendment to the SM. An amended sample ACAN is attached (<strong>Annex A</strong>).</p>
