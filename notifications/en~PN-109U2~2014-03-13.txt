<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification 109U2 (PN-109U2) is to reflect changes to the Canadian Content Policy as set out in the Defence Procurement Strategy (DPS).</p>
<h2>Effective date</h2>
<p>PN-109U2 and the related changes to the <cite>Supply Manual</cite>, <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual and Standard Procurement Templates are effective March 13, 2014.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On February 5, 2014, Canada’s new <abbr title="Defence Procurement Strategy">DPS</abbr> was launched. The <abbr title="Defence Procurement Strategy">DPS</abbr> fulfills the Government’s commitment to ensure defence equipment procurement creates economic opportunities and jobs for Canadians. <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr> 109 (Defence Procurement Strategy) provided information on the various components of the strategy. </p>
<h2>Policy</h2>
<p>The Canadian Content Policy limits the competition for a covered procurement to Canadian goods/services if there is sufficient competition.  At the current time, "<dfn>sufficient competition</dfn>" is defined as at least 3 eligible suppliers (i.e. suppliers of Canadian goods/services); as a result of the <abbr title="Defence Procurement Strategy">DPS</abbr>, "<dfn>sufficient competition</dfn>" for the Policy will be defined as at least 2 eligible suppliers.</p>
<p>The Canadian Content Policy can be found in <cite>Supply Manual</cite> <a href="https://canadabuys.canada.ca/en/how-procurement-works/policies-and-guidelines/supply-manual/chapter-3-annexes#_3-6">Annex 3.6 Canadian Content Policy</a> of the <cite>Supply Manual</cite>.</p>
<p>This change will be effective March 13, 2014, at which time, the change will be reflected in the ABE system (Canadian content application code).</p>

<h2>Revisions to the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual</h2>
<p>The text of <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual Clause A3070T – Evaluation Procedures for Procurement Conditionally Limited to Canadian Content is revised.

<h2>Standard Procurement Templates</h2>
<p>The Higher Complexity (HC) and Medium Complexity (MC) Bid Solicitation and Resulting Contract Templates as well as the Request for Standing Offers (RFSO) Template are revised under Part 4 titled Evaluation Procedures and Basis of Selection to reflect this change</p>
