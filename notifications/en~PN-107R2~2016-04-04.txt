<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification 107R2 (PN-107R2) is to notify Acquisitions Program personnel that the Integrity Provisions used in Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC)’s procurement and real property transactions are being updated.</p>
<p>The Integrity Provisions and the <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/politique-policy-eng.html" rel="external"><em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em></a> are being modified to provide clarity regarding the <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/ci-if-eng.html" rel="external">Integrity Regime</a> based on feedback received from contracting officers, other government departments and suppliers. The modifications do not change how the Regime is applied and administered.</p>
<h3>Effective date</h3>
<p>PN107R2 is effective April 4, 2016.</p>
<h3>Summary of requirements</h3>
<p>The Integrity Provisions are being amended to incorporate the updated <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em> by reference, which includes simplified language and provides additional information on processes.</p>
<p>Contracting officers are instructed to include the latest Integrity Provisions in any new solicitation documents and resulting contracts to reflect the revised approach. All solicitations currently on the Government of Canada’s tendering system will not be impacted and no amendments are required.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Over the past several years, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> has implemented numerous measures to strengthen the integrity of the Department’s procurement and real property transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>July 2012</strong>: <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> established a formal Integrity Framework, under its own authorities, designed to ensure that the Government does not enter into contracts with suppliers that have criminal convictions in Canada. </li>
<li><strong>November 2012</strong> and <strong>March 2014</strong>:  Subsequent enhancements to the Framework were made (<a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/policy-notifications/PN-107">ARCHIVED – Integrity Provisions – PN-107</a> and <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/policy-notifications/PN-107U1">ARCHIVED – Integrity Provisions – PN-107U1</a>)  and it was expanded to include foreign offences, affiliate convictions of a supplier and to require that suppliers extend the same terms and conditions to subcontractors.</li>
<li><strong>July 2015</strong>: <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> implemented a new government-wide Integrity Regime for its procurement and real property transactions to ensure that the Government of Canada does business with ethical suppliers (<a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/policy-notifications/PN-107R1">ARCHIVED – Integrity Provisions – PN-107R1</a>). The Integrity Regime is a policy-based approach that applies across federal departments and agencies through memoranda of understanding.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Summary of revisions</h3>
<h4>The Integrity Provisions are being updated to:</h4>
<ul>
<li>incorporate the updated <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy </em>by reference into solicitations and resulting contracts;</li>

<li>require that bidders, offerors or suppliers certify to the following when submitting a bid:</li>

<li>they have provided a list of all foreign criminal charges and convictions;</li>
<li>none of the domestic criminal offences and other circumstances described in the Policy applies to them, their affiliates and their first tier subcontractors; and</li>
<li>they are not aware of a determination of ineligibility or suspension that applies to them. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>The <em>Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</em> is being updated to:</h4>
<ul>
<li>provide clarification on types of contracts that are exempt from the Policy, that were previously found in the related Directives;</li>
<li>provide greater details regarding the process used to make a determination of ineligibility or suspension;</li>

<li>clearly state that deputy heads of departments and agencies are responsible for approving Public Interest Exceptions for contracts within their authority and the use of ineligible first tier subcontractors;</li>
<li>modify references to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services’ responsibilities to state that they are <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>’s responsibilities;</li>
<li>identify when contracting officers are required to submit information to the Registrar of ineligibility and suspension.</li>
