<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The departmental <a class="gov" href="http://gcintranet.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/pm-dp/politique-policy/pfm-pse-eng.html" rel="external">Policy on Fairness Monitoring</a><span> (accessible only on the Government of Canada network)</span> took effect on October 10, 2020, replacing the Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) Policy on Fairness Monitoring dated June 21, 2012.</p>
<p>The principal policy changes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarification of the conditions that require mandatory assessments:</strong> Mandatory assessments are required for all departmental activities subject to Ministerial or Treasury Board approval and competitive procurements for which the Procurement Complexity Assessment is level 4 or 5; or the Procurement Risk Assessment (PRA) level is medium high or high.</li>
<li><strong>Change to the approval level for assessments:</strong> The approvals for assessments that recommend fairness monitoring coverage are now approved by the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Departmental Oversight Branch. Approvals for mandatory assessments that recommend not to use a fairness monitor continue to be approved by the Deputy Minister.</li>
<li><strong>Option to request fairness monitoring when a mandatory assessment is not required:</strong> There is the option to request fairness monitoring for departmental activities that are not subject to a mandatory assessment but where an enhanced assurance of fairness is desired.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the new policy now includes links to the following key tools and resources:</p>
