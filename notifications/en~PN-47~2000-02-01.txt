<p>The policy to seek the Deputy Minister's approval for authority to firm up interim rates if the contract has been approved by Treasury Board is rescinded, effective immediately.</p>
<p>The requirement to obtain the DM's approval is identified in the Supply Manual under Annex 6.1.5 paragraph 9 (c), Rates (or Prices-to-be-negotiated) / Interim Rates (or Prices). This policy, implemented as an internal control measure, applied whenever the original contract, with the interim rates, was approved by Treasury Board.</p>
<p>The Supply Manual will be revised to reflect this change, as indicated in <strong>Annex A</strong>.</p>
<p>The next release of the Supply Manual is scheduled for May 12, 2000.</p>
