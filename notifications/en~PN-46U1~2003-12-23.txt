<li>Treasury Board Secretariat has provided notice of the amendment of previously established thresholds for the international trade agreements. The new thresholds in Canadian dollars are applicable for two years, from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005.</li>
<li>Canada-Korea Telecommunications Equipment Procurement Agreement (CKTEA) has the same threshold for goods as the Agreement on Government Procurement of the World Trade Organization (<acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym>); therefore, the CKTEA threshold in Canadian dollars has also changed.</li>
