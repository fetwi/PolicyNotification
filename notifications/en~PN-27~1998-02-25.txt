<h5>Introduction:</h5>
<p>This Policy Notification is issued to implement new procedures for setting aside procurements covered by NAFTA and the <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym> that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements, National Park Agreements, or DND Co-operation Agreements<sup><a href="#PN-27n_1">(1)</a></sup>. These procurements will continue to be set aside from NAFTA and the <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym>. However, additional information specific to the applicable land claims agreement must now be incorporated into the Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP) and bid solicitation.</p>
<h5>Background:</h5>
<p>Legal counsel at the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade has concluded that it will be necessary to establish clearly circumscribed set-aside policies in order to carry out the federal government's obligations under the land claims agreements and, also comply with Canada's obligations under NAFTA and the <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym>.</p>
<h5>Policy:</h5>
<p>Based on this advice, Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) has advised us to implement the procedures described below based on the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Contracting Policy Notice 1997-8. A set-aside policy has been developed for each land claims agreement, specific to the federal government's obligations contained therein. It is important to note that the extent of preferences to the claimant group are restricted to the federal government's obligations under the applicable land claims agreement. This policy does not apply to procurements set aside from NAFTA or the <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym> under the Set-Aside Program for Aboriginal Business.</p>
<h5>Procedures</h5>
<p>1. Determine whether a procurement is covered by both a land claims agreement and NAFTA and/or the <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym>.</p>
<p>2. If a procurement is subject to NAFTA and/or the <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym>, and one or more of the land claims agreements, the portion for delivery within the land claims settlement areas should be procured separately from the portion for delivery outside of the land claims settlement areas, where this is feasible.</p>
<p>3. The portion of the procurement for delivery outside of the land claims settlement areas will continue to be procured according to the provisions in the NAFTA or the <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym>, as applicable.</p>
<p>4. The procurement (or portion of the procurement) covered by a land claims agreement is to be set aside from NAFTA and the <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym>. The provision for "set-asides for small and minority businesses" is found in NAFTA, Annex 1001.2b, General Notes Schedule of Canada, Article 1.(d) and the <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym> Annex 5, General Notes, Article 1.(d). In order to effect that set-aside, specific references from the applicable land claims agreements must be inserted into the NPP and the bid solicitation. This procurement will be known as a Land Claims Set-Aside" or "LCSA".</p>
<p>5. The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Contracting Policy Notice 1997-8 identifies Canada's contracting obligations under each land claims agreement. The chart, entitled Summary of Benefits from Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Contracting Policy Notice 1997-8, attached at Annex A, was derived from this Notice. Using this chart, determine which provisions in the applicable land claims agreements apply. Ensure that only the relevant provisions are selected. For example, provisions related to silviculture would not apply to a procurement for food services.</p>
<p>6. Insert the following information at the beginning of the text box in the NPP.</p>
<ul>
<li>"This procurement is set aside from <span aria-label="Blank placeholder" class="blankline"></span>  (insert as applicable the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement) pursuant to Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Contracting Policy Notice 1997-8  of December 10, 1997."</li>
</ul>
<p>7. Insert the following information at the end of the text box in the NPP.</p>
<ul>
<li>"The benefits that apply to this procurement are contained in: (<em>list the applicable section, corresponding land claims agreement, and relevant provisions from the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Contracting Policy 1997-8. Refer to Annex B for the provision numbers. Do not include the text of the provisions in the NPP.</em>)"</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a procurement that is subject to the Inuvialuit Final Agreement might read as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li> "The benefits that apply to this procurement are contained in: Section 2, the Inuvialuit Final Agreement, clauses 16(8), (b), (c)."</li>
</ul>
<p>8. Insert the following information at the beginning of the bid solicitation.</p>
<ul>
<li>"This procurement is set aside from <span aria-label="Blank placeholder" class="blankline"></span>  (insert as applicable, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement) pursuant to Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Contracting Policy Notice 1997-8 of December 10, 1997."</li>
</ul>
<p>A copy of this clause is provided in Annex C. It will be incorporated into the SACC Manual.</p>
<p>9. The following sentence and the text of the applicable provisions from the land claims agreements must be inserted at the end of the bid solicitation, but before any annexes or appendices.</p>
<ul>
<li>"The benefits that apply to this procurement are contained in: (<em>Indicate the applicable section, corresponding land claims agreement and relevant provisions in full text. Refer to Annex B for the provisions.)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a procurement that is subject to the Inuvialuit Agreement might read as follows.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The benefits that apply to this procurement are contained in: section 2, The Inuvialuit Final Agreement, clauses:</p>
<p>16.(8) Economic Measures</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to expand the role of the Inuvialuit Development Corporation and its subsidiaries in the supply and delivery of goods and services in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and the Inuvialuit communities, to strengthen the economic viability of the renewable resource sector in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, to diversify the economy of the Western Arctic, and to assist the IDC and the Inuvialuit in contributing to the development of the private sector, the Government shall:</p>
<ul class="noBullet">
<li>(b) notify the Inuvialuit of all government contracts subject to public tender that relate to activities in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and the Inuvialuit communities. Where the Inuvialuit submit the best bid having regard to price, quality, delivery and other stipulated conditions, the contract shall be awarded to the Inuvialuit; and</li>
<li>(c) notify the Inuvialuit Development Corporation of instances where Federal government procurement of goods and services related to activities in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region takes place on a basis other than public tender. If the Inuvialuit are capable of supplying those goods and services on a reasonable basis, they shall receive a reasonable share of the contracts so awarded."</li>
</ul>
<p>10. Special clauses have been developed for use in solicitations and contracts or standing offers which involve or could involve deliveries to locations inside land claims settlement areas. These clauses, copies of which are attached at Annex C, will be incorporated into the SACC Manual. The Remarks section of each clause details its use.</p>
<p>11. Procurements to which NAFTA and/or the <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym> applied must be coded accordingly; procurements which were set-aside under this Land Claims Set-Aside Policy must be coded as LCSA and identified as a "set-asides for small and minority businesses" derogation. The Automated Buyer Environment (ABE) will be modified to add two new agreement types - LCSA and LCSA/AIT. When the same supplier is successful on both solicitations, separate contractual documents must be issued in order to satisfy system coding requirements for the respective agreement types.</p>
<p>12. Questions about this policy may be directed to Heather Harrison, Supply Policy Directorate, 819-956-0912.</p>

<p>14.6 Prior to inviting bids by public notice for Government Contracts related to the Park Canada shall solicit bids from suppliers of goods and services, firstly from with Paulatuk and secondly from within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR). When soliciting bids:</p>
<ul class="noBullet">

<p><strong>W0001T (__/__/98) DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS OUTSIDE CLCSA</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remarks:</strong></p>
<p>This clause is to be used in solicitations involving final delivery to locations <strong>outside </strong>Comprehensive Land Claims Settlement Areas (CLCSA) when the original requirement has been divided to handle final delivery locations <strong>outside </strong>CLCSAs on one solicitation and final delivery locations <strong>inside </strong>CLCSAs on a different solicitation. Officers are to modify the clauses as required for either a standing offer or contract and to insert the solicitation number dealing with deliveries inside CLCSAs.</p>
<p>The second paragraph of this clause is to cover the eventuality of there being no bids received as a result of the solicitation pertaining to delivery locations inside a CLCSA. The clause gives the Crown the capability to include final delivery locations inside CLCSAs in the proposed standing offer/contract with the successful bidder of the solicitation for delivery points outside CLCSAs.</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong></p>
<p>Any resulting (Standing Offer(s) Contract(s)) shall be for delivery requirements to locations within Canada, except locations within Comprehensive Land Claims Settlement Areas.

<p>In the event that there (is/are) no (Standing Offer(s)/Contract(s)) (issued/awarded) pursuant to solicitation number<span aria-label="Blank placeholder" class="blankline"></span>  (insert applicable number), the Crown reserves the right to negotiate for deliveries within Comprehensive Land Claims Settlement Areas with suppliers who have been approved for (issuance/award) of a (Standing Offer/Contract) under this (Request for Standing Offer/Request for Proposal).</p>

Officers are to modify the clause as required for either a standing offer or contract.</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong></p>
<p>The (resulting/Standing Offer/Contract) is not to be used for deliveries within a Comprehensive Land Claims Settlement Area. All requirements for delivery within a Comprehensive Land Claims Settlement Area are to be submitted to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> for individual processing.</p>
