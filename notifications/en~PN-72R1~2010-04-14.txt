<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Policy Notification (PN)-72R1 replaces PN-72R, dated November 14, 2006, in its entirety. PN-72R1 is a companion to, and should be read in conjunction with PN-92, Commodity Management Policy, and with the provisions of applicable chapters of the <em>Supply Manual</em>.  In case of conflict between the <em>Supply Manual</em> and this <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>, the provisions of PN-72R1 will take precedence.</p>
<p>PN-72R1 provides direction to contracting officers on the creation, renewal or extension of standing offers (SOs) (National Master Standing Offer [NMSO], National Individual Standing Offer [NISO], Regional Master Standing Offer [RMSO], Regional Individual Standing Offer [RISO], Departmental Individual Standing Offer [DISO]) and supply arrangements (SAs).</p>
<p>Requests for all <abbr title="standing offers">SOs</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangements">SAs</abbr>, regardless of dollar value or transaction type, related to commodities covered by National Approaches are outside the scope of PN-72R1 and must be addressed by following the instructions provided in PN-92.</p>
<p>PN-72R1 aims to reduce duplication of <abbr title="standing offers">SOs</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangements">SAs</abbr>, increase the effectiveness, efficiency and level of quality of <abbr title="standing offers">SOs</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangements">SAs</abbr>, and ensure that within each <abbr title="standing offer">SO</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangement">SA</abbr>, applicable national/regional and social objectives are addressed.  It outlines the roles and responsibilities for individuals involved in the process.</p>
<h3>Policy</h3>
<p>Requests for the creation, renewal and extension of <strong><abbr title="standing offers">SOs</abbr></strong> (<abbr title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</abbr>, <abbr title="National Individual Standing Offer">NISO</abbr>, <abbr title="Regional Master Standing Offer">RMSO</abbr>, <abbr title="Regional Individual Standing Offer">RISO</abbr>, <abbr title="Departmental Individual Standing Offer">DISO</abbr>) and/or <strong><abbr title="supply arrangements">SAs</abbr></strong> require advance endorsement by either the designated Commodity Manager/Officer of Primary Interest (CM/OPI) identified for those goods or services, or if there is no CM/OPI, by a Regional Reviewer (RR) who is designated for each region.  If there is no CM/OPI/RR, the Manager, Commodity Coordination Division within the Performance, Spend and Commodity Management Directorate, will perform the review.</p>
<p>All individuals conducting reviews of <abbr title="standing offer">SO</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangement">SA</abbr> requests are referred to in this document as "Reviewer".  A list of reviewers is available and regularly updated in the <a href="http://soi.pwgsc.gc.ca/app/index.cfm?Fuseaction=prg.main&amp;altlang=-e" rel="external">Standing Offer Index</a> (SOI).</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<ol class="double-space">
<li>
<strong>Review</strong>
<p>Before the creation, renewal or extension of any <abbr title="standing offer">SO</abbr> (<abbr title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</abbr>, <abbr title="National Individual Standing Offer">NISO</abbr>, <abbr title="Regional Master Standing Offer">RMSO</abbr>, <abbr title="Regional Individual Standing Offer">RISO</abbr>, <abbr title="Departmental Individual Standing Offer">DISO</abbr>) and/or <abbr title="supply arrangement">SA</abbr>, and/or whether or not the extension period was pre-approved in the original document, the contracting officer must submit the "Request for Reviewer Endorsement"  (see <a href="#PN-72R1ann-a">Annex A</a>) to the appropriate Reviewer (see the <a href="http://soi.pwgsc.gc.ca/app/index.cfm?Fuseaction=prg.main&amp;altlang=-e" rel="external">Standing Offer Index</a> for complete listing).</p>
<p>The Reviewer will:</p>
<ol class="single-space" type="a">
<li>"endorse without comment/recommendations"; or</li>
<li>"endorse with comments/recommendations/conditions"; or</li>
<li>"decline with supporting rationale".</li>
</ol>
<p>If endorsed with comments/recommendations/conditions or declined, contracting officers can revise their request and resubmit it to the Reviewer.</p>
<p>The Reviewer's endorsement with or without comments/recommendations/conditions, or the rationale for declining, must be included in the Contract Planning and Advance Contract (CPAA) or Procurement Plan.</p>
<p>Existing contract approval authorities remain in place and approval authorities must ensure that the Reviewer's comments/recommendations/conditions, or the rationale for declining, are included in the approval documentation for the new or amended <abbr title="standing offer">SO</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangement">SA</abbr> before approving or not.</p>
<p>Contracting officers are encouraged to contact the Reviewer during the planning phase in order to obtain input and possibly expedite the review process.</p>
<p><a href="#PN-72R1ann-b">Annex B</a> provides instructions and reporting requirements for Reviewers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Posting <abbr title="standing offers">SOs</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangements">SAs</abbr> Files</strong>
<p>Managers are responsible for ensuring that:</p>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>all <abbr title="standing offers">SOs</abbr> (<abbr title="National Master Standing Offer">NMSO</abbr>, <abbr title="National Individual Standing Offer">NISO</abbr>, <abbr title="Regional Master Standing Offer">RMSO</abbr>, <abbr title="Regional Individual Standing Offer">RISO</abbr>, <abbr title="Departmental Individual Standing Offer">DISO</abbr>) and/or <abbr title="supply arrangements">SAs</abbr> are posted in the <a href="http://soi.pwgsc.gc.ca/app/index.cfm?Fuseaction=prg.main&amp;altlang=-e" rel="external">Standing Offer Index</a> (SOI);</li>
<li>information posted on the <a href="http://soi.pwgsc.gc.ca/app/index.cfm?Fuseaction=prg.main&amp;altlang=-e" rel="external">Standing Offer Index</a> is accurate, includes the original <abbr title="standing offer">SO</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangement">SA</abbr> document, sequence of amendments and tombstone documentation, such as contracting officer name and phone number.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Use of Departmental Standard Procurement Documents</strong>
<p>Contracting officers must use the standard procurement templates available on the Departmental Standard Procurement Documents Web site for the issuance of Request for Standing Offers/Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSOs/RFSAs) for goods, services or both.  <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions</em> (SACC) Manual clauses must be used in the development of procurement documents; however, other clauses may be included, if approved by Legal Services, for a specific requirement.  If such clauses are to be used on a regular basis, they must be included in the <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual by submitting them to the Procurement Process Tools Division, Acquisition Policy and Process Directorate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Usage Data Reporting</strong>
<p>The previous version of this <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr> required that all <abbr title="standing offer">SO</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangement">SA</abbr> usage data be reported to the Value Management Office (VMO); this is no longer required.</p>
<p>Contracting officers should carefully think through the reporting requirements for <abbr title="standing offers">SOs</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangements">SAs</abbr>, so that they can manage and monitor such procurement methods adequately.  Once the reporting requirements have been identified, contracting officers should consider the best approach for meeting these requirements.  There are various sources available for usage reports, e.g. client departments, in-house tracking system, commodity management teams, office of prime interest, Spend Cube Application and offerors/suppliers.  There may even be instances where usage reports are not required.</p>
<p>If it is determined that it would be necessary to obtain usage reports from offerors/suppliers, as is typically the case with multi-departmental <abbr title="standing offers">SOs</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangements">SAs</abbr>, contracting officers must:</p>
<ol class="single-space" type="a">
<li>provide a clear description of the reporting requirements in the <abbr title="Request for Standing Offers">RFSOs</abbr>/<abbr title="Request for Supply Arrangements">RFSAs</abbr> and subsequent <abbr title="standing offer">SO</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangement">SA</abbr>, including the required data elements and the frequency of the reports;</li>
<li>ensure that the information is provided as required in the <abbr title="standing offer">SO</abbr>/<abbr title="supply arrangement">SA</abbr>;</li>
<li>analyze the reports and take timely corrective measures as necessary; and,</li>
<li>document procurement files adequately.</li>
