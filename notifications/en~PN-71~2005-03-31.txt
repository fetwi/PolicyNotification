<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The purpose of this Policy Notification (PN) is to introduce and implement Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement templates, including new standard instructions and new general conditions to be used by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) contracting officers for the procurement of goods or services (excluding construction).</p>
<h3>Policy</h3>
<p>Effective June 10, 2005, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> contracting officers must use the Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement documents for Low Dollar Value (LDV) and Medium Complexity requirements for goods or services for competitive and non-competitive requirements.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a 'common look and feel' for the Department's procurement documents, contracting officers must not modify or change the order and content of these standard templates except where indicated.</p>
<p>New bid solicitations and resulting contract procurement templates, new standard instructions and general conditions are to be used for LDV and Medium Complexity requirements for goods or services as identified in the table below.</p>

<p>* Standard Instructions and Conditions 9403 and 9403-5 will remain active in the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual for use with requirements other than LDV and Medium Complexity requirements. General Conditions 9628, 9329 and 9601-10 will be cancelled effective June 10, 2005.</p>
<p>The Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement documents will be available in the June 2005 release of the SACC Manual as attached at <a href="#PN-71anna">Annex A</a>.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Parliamentary Secretary's Task Force Final Report dated January 2005 on Government-Wide Review of Procurement stipulates that procurement terminology should be standardized, and standardized plain language documents should be developed to contribute to the simplification and efficiency of the contracting process. </p>
<p>The Acquisitions Branch Business Plan (2004-05 to 2006-07) identifies the development of Plain Language Standard Procurement Templates as a key priority in the Department.</p>
<p>The objective of this initiative is to standardize procurement terminology, simplify the language and ensure more consistency and uniformity in acquisition documents issued by the Department (e.g. 'common look and feel').</p>
<p>Templates have been identified for three different types of procurement for goods or services, for both competitive and non-competitive procurement, as detailed below.</p>
<h4>1. Low Dollar Value Requirements below $25K (including applicable taxes)</h4>
<p><strong>Includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Low risk requirements</li>
<li>Requirements with highly predictable application of standard terms and conditions</li>
<li>Requirements below $25K (including all applicable taxes)</li>
<li>Requirements with standard well defined requirements and specifications</li>
<li>Basis of selection is based on lowest priced bid; may include mandatory evaluation criteria; </li>
<li>Examples which may fall under this type: preconfigured product specifications, some services requirements, aviation parts, etc.</li>
<li>Additional annexes and clauses to meet specific commodity needs may be added to the templates subject to the parameters for use of LDV requirements and depending on the requirement. Where Limitation of Liability is part of the requirement and it is intended to use the Low Dollar Value template and General Conditions 2029, additional clauses will be required in the template in accordance with the SACC Manual. Refer to Treasury Board 'Policy on Decision Making in Limiting Contractor Liability in Crown Procurement Contracts - effective as September 1, 2003'</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Excludes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LDV Requirements with point rated technical and financial evaluation criteria (Medium Complexity)</li>
<li>Standing Offers</li>
<li>Supply arrangements </li>
<li>Real Property contracting requirements</li>
<li>Canadian Commercial Corporation requirements</li>
<li>Aboriginal requirements and set asides</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Medium Complexity Requirements</h4>
<p><strong>Includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Medium risk requirements</li>
<li>Requirements with standard well defined requirements and specifications</li>
<li>Requirements with predictable application of standard terms and conditions</li>
<li>Requirements that may involve high volume of transactions</li>
<li>Evaluation and Basis of Selection are based on price, technical and financial evaluation criteria </li>
<li>Examples which may fall under this type: some commercial products, some electrical and electronics products, some commercial spare parts with military specifications, some services requirements, some information management/information technology (IM/IT) requirements, except those which require the use of Supplemental General Conditions</li>
<li>Additional annexes and clauses to meet specific commodity needs may be added to the templates subject to the parameters for use of Medium Complexity requirements and depending on the requirement. Where Limitation of Liability is part of the requirement and it is intended to use the Medium Complexity template and General Conditions 2010, additional clauses will be required in the template in accordance with the SACC Manual. Refer to Treasury Board 'Policy on Decision Making in Limiting Contractor Liability in Crown Procurement Contracts - effective as September 1, 2003'</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Excludes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Standing Offers</li>
<li>Supply Arrangements </li>
<li>Real Property contracting requirements</li>
<li>Canadian Commercial Corporation requirements</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Higher Complexity Requirements (under development)</h4>
<p><strong>Includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher risk requirements</li>
<li>Requirements with reasonably predictable application of standard terms and conditions</li>
<li>Requirements where there is a need for some development work and performance management; may involve project management </li>
<li>Evaluation and Basis of Selection is based on price, technical and financial evaluation criteria</li>
<li>Examples which fall under this type: research and development requirements, professional services, IM/IT requirements, large aviation requirements, services requirements, etc.</li>
<li>Requirements where General Conditions 9676, 9624, 9601 and supplemental general conditions are usually used</li>
<li>Additional annexes and clauses to meet specific commodity needs may be added depending on the requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Excludes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Standing Offers</li>

<li>Real Property contracting requirements</li>
<li>Canadian Commercial Corporation requirements</li>
</ul>
<h3>Major Crown Projects and Other Requirements:</h3>
<p>Major Crown Projects and requirements where standard terms and conditions are generally not applicable and where contracting is completely a forward-looking strategic pursuit of solutions (some information management/information technology (IM/IT), secure channel, Government of Canada Marketplace (GAMC), Maritime Helicopters Project (MHO), etc.).</p>
<p>These requirements are not covered by this initiative.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Annex A contains the new 2003 Standard Instructions, the new 2029 General Conditions, the new 2010 General Conditions and the Low Dollar Value (LDV) and Medium Complexity templates, which will be available in the June 2005 release of the SACC Manual and the Supply Manual (SM). The documents will be available on the Internet and the clauses contained in the template documents (LDV and Medium Complexity Templates) will be available in ABE (Automated Buyer Environment) as local clauses. </p>
<p>Contracting officers will be required to use these documents for LDV and Medium Complexity requirements no later than June 10, 2005.</p>
<h3>Example using Template</h3>
<p>An example of an LDV requirement using the LDV template is provided in <a href="#PN-71annc">Annex C</a>.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>Prior to the effective implementation date, the Procurement Process Tools Division the will provide information to procurement managers, on the application and use of this document, at briefings to be scheduled. The contracting officers will then receive this information from their respective procurement managers. Questions from contracting officers must be submitted to their respective procurement managers who will forward them, if applicable, to the contact provided below.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>The Plain Language Working Group will review and develop standard procurement documents (e.g. Plain Language Templates, standard instructions and general conditions for bid solicitations and contracts) for Higher Complexity requirements, for supply arrangements, and for standing offers. </p>
<p>Procurement Process Tools Division is responsible for the ongoing maintenance of the Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement Templates, the standard instructions and the general conditions for LDV and Medium Complexity requirements and all modifications to these documents will be published in future releases of the SACC Manual and the SM. </p>
<p>The documents will also be available on the Internet and the clauses contained in the template documents (LDV and Medium Complexity Templates) will be available in ABE as local clauses.</p>

<h3><a id="PN-71anna" name="anna"></a>APPENDIX 1 TO ANNEX A</h3>
<h4>2T-PROC1 Procedures for Using the Low Dollar Value and Medium Complexity Templates</h4>
<p>Contracting officers must use the Low Dollar Value (LDV) and the Medium Complexity documents in accordance with these procedures.</p>
<h4>LDV and Medium Complexity Competitive and Non-Competitive requirements</h4>
<p>Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement Templates as well as standard Instructions and general Conditions have been developed in consultation with Public Works and Government Services Canada (<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>) Legal Services and must be used for standard, well defined requirements for goods or services in a competitive or non-competitive (sole source) environment. 2003 Standard Instructions - Goods or Services is to be used in lieu of Standard Instructions and Conditions 9403 and 9403-5, for LDV and Medium Complexity requirements. 2029 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Low Dollar Value) is to be used in lieu of General Conditions 9329 and General Conditions 9628 for LDV requirements. 2010 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Medium Complexity) is to be used in lieu of General Conditions 9601-10. Standard Instructions and Conditions 9403 and 9403-5 will remain active in the Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual for use with requirements other than LDV and Medium Complexity requirements. General Conditions 9628, 9329 and 9601-10 will be cancelled effective June 10, 2005.</p>
<p>SACC Manual clauses may be added to the bid solicitation and contract templates as necessary for the requirement and provided they are not already included in the new 2003 Standard Instructions - Good or Services, the new 2029 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Low Dollar Value) or the new 2010 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Medium Complexity). Contracting officers may add additional clauses, as applicable, in the templates as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clauses must be incorporated by reference under 'SACC Manual Clauses' provided in the different sections of the templates unless there are blanks to be filled in. While incorporating SACC clauses by reference may be contrary to current procedures identified under the Remarks section of the SACC Manual, this approach is recommended by Legal and must be followed when using the Plain Language Templates;</li>
<li>Clauses with blanks must be added in full text, within the appropriate section in the templates;</li>
<li>Other pertinent clauses may be added within the appropriate section to address commodity requirements in the templates as required; and,</li>
<li>Annexes may be added for specific commodity needs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>TEMPLATES</h4>
<p><strong>1. 2T- LDV1 Low Dollar Value Bid Solicitation and Resulting Contract Template - Goods or Services:</strong> The Bid Solicitation template includes the new 2003 Standard Instructions - Goods or Services incorporated by reference. The Contract template includes the new 2029 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Low Dollar Value), incorporated by reference. The Contract template will also apply when quotes are obtained through Request for Quotations (RFQ) or telephone buys for competitive requirements and the lowest price bid is accepted; or, when a quote is obtained through an RFQ or a telephone buy for non-competitive sole source requirements. Where the Bid Solicitation is not used, delete Part 1 and the title 'Part 2 - Resulting Contract Clauses' before use.
          </p>
<p><strong>2. 2T- MED1 Medium Complexity Bid Solicitation and Resulting Contract Template - Goods or Services:</strong> The Bid Solicitation template includes 2003 Standard Instructions - Goods or Services, incorporated by reference. The Contract template includes 2010 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Medium Complexity), incorporated by reference. Where the Bid Solicitation is not used, retain Part 4 only of the document and delete the title 'Part 4 - Resulting Contract Clauses' before use.</p>
<p><strong>3. Notes to Templates:</strong><br/>
            The Contracting Authority must ensure there are no contradictions, inconsistencies and redundancies with the clauses contained in the templates, the standard instructions and the general conditions. </p>
<p>The Bid Solicitation templates and the Contract templates include instructional information, as applicable. All this instructional information must be removed before issuing the documents.</p>
<p>In English, the words 'Contractor', 'Bidder', 'Work', 'Contract' and 'Contracting Authority' are capitalized when they are in the singular and preceded by 'the' because, with the exception of 'Bidder', they are defined in the Contract. <br/>
            In French, this rule for capitalization does not apply.</p>

</ul>
<h4>01. Procurement Business Number</h4>
<p>Canadian suppliers are required to have a Procurement Business Number (PBN) before Contract award. Suppliers may register for a PBN in the Supplier Registration Information service on line at the Buy and Sell Internet site at: <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/">https://buyandsell.gc.ca/</a>. For non-Internet registration, suppliers may contact the Buy and Sell InfoLine at 1-800-811-1148 or, in the National Capital Area at 819-956-3440, to obtain the telephone number of the nearest Supplier Registration Agent.</p>
<h4>02. Instructions, Conditions and Clauses</h4>
<p>Pursuant to the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act, S.C. 1996, c.16, the instructions, conditions and clauses identified by title, number and a date in the bid solicitation and resulting contract are incorporated by reference into and form part of the bid solicitation and resulting contract as though expressly set out in the bid solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<h4>03. Submission of Bids</h4>
<p>(1) Canada requires that each bid be signed by the Bidder or by an authorized representative of the Bidder. If a bid is being submitted by a joint venture, the bid must clearly state that it is submitted as a joint venture and must be signed by all members of the joint venture or a statement must be provided to the effect that the signatory represents all members of the joint venture.</p>
<p>(2) It is the Bidder's responsibility to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>obtain clarification of the requirements contained in the bid solicitation, if necessary, prior to submitting a bid;</li>
<li>prepare its bid in accordance with the instructions contained in the bid solicitation;</li>
<li>submit by closing time and date a signed and complete bid;</li>
<li>send its bid ONLY to Public Works and Government Services Canada (<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>) Bid Receiving Unit specified on page 1 of the bid solicitation or to the address specified in the bid solicitation;</li>
<li>ensure that the Bidder's name, return address, the bid solicitation number, and bid solicitation closing date and time are clearly visible on the envelope or the parcel(s) containing the bid; and,</li>
<li>provide a comprehensible and sufficiently detailed bid, including all requested pricing details, that will permit a complete evaluation in accordance with the criteria set out in the bid solicitation.</li>
</ol>
<p>(3) If Canada has provided bidders with multiple formats of a document (for example, a document may be downloaded through the GETS, but may also be made available on CD-ROM through GETS), the format downloaded through the GETS will take precedence. If Canada issues an amendment to the bid solicitation revising any documents provided to bidders in multiple formats, Canada will not necessarily update all formats to reflect these revisions. It is the Bidder's responsibility to ensure that revisions made through any solicitation amendment issued through the GETS are taken into account in the alternate formats it uses of bid solicitation documents.</p>
<p>(4) Bids will remain open for acceptance for a period of not less than sixty (60) days from the closing date of the bid solicitation, unless otherwise indicated in the bid solicitation. Canada reserves the right to seek an extension of the bid validity period from all responsive bidders in writing, within a minimum of three (3) days prior to the end of the bid validity period. If the extension is accepted by all responsive bidders, Canada will continue with the evaluation of the bids. If the extension is not accepted by all responsive bidders, Canada will, at its sole discretion, either continue with the evaluation of the bids of those who have accepted the extension or cancel the solicitation.</p>
<p>            (5) Bid documents and supporting information may be submitted in either English or French.</p>
<p>(6) In the case of error in the extension of prices, the unit price will govern. </p>
<p>            (7) For Canadian-based bidders, Canadian customs duties and excise taxes must be included and, Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) must be excluded. For foreign-based bidders, Canadian customs duties, excise taxes and GST or HST, must be excluded. Canadian customs duties and excise taxes payable by Canada will be added, for evaluation purposes only, to the prices submitted by foreign-based bidders.</p>
<p>Although Canada reserves the right to award the contract(s) either on an FOB plant or FOB destination basis or other Incoterms as indicated in the bid solicitation document, bidders are requested to provide prices as indicated in the bid solicitation document. </p>
<p>(8) Bids received on or before the stipulated bid solicitation closing date and time will become the property of Canada and will not be returned. All bids will be treated as confidential, subject to the provisions of the Access to Information Act R.S.1985, c.A-1 and the Privacy Act R.S.1985, c.P-21.</p>
<p>(9) Except as specifically provided otherwise in the bid solicitation, Canada will evaluate a bidder's bid only on the documentation provided as part of its bid. References in a bid to additional information not submitted with the bid, such as website addresses where additional information can be found or technical manuals or brochures not submitted with the bid will not be considered in the evaluation of the bid.</p>
<h4>04. Late Bids </h4>
<p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> will return bids delivered after the stipulated bid solicitation closing date and time, unless they qualify as a delayed bid as described below.</p>
<h4>05. Delayed Bids</h4>
<p>(1) A bid delivered to the specified Bid Receiving Unit after the closing date and time but before the contract award date may be considered, provided the delay can be proven to have been due solely to a delay in delivery that can be attributed to the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) (or national equivalent of a foreign country). Purolator Inc. is not considered to be part of CPC for the purposes of delayed bids. The only pieces of evidence relating to a delay in the CPC system that are acceptable to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> are:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>a CPC cancellation date stamp; or</li>
<li>a CPC Priority Courier Bill of Lading; or</li>
<li>a CPC Xpresspost Label</li>
</ol>
<p>that clearly indicates that the bid was mailed before the bid closing date.</p>
<p>(2) For bids transmitted by facsimile, only the date, time and place of receipt recorded by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> will be accepted as evidence of a delayed bid.</p>
<p>(3) Misrouting, traffic volume, weather disturbances, labour disputes or any other causes for the late delivery of bids are not acceptable reasons for the bid to be accepted by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.</p>
<p>(4) Postage meter imprints, whether imprinted by the Bidder, the CPC or the postal authority outside Canada, are not acceptable as proof of timely mailing. </p>
<h4>06. Transmission by Facsimile</h4>
<p>(1) Unless otherwise instructed in the bid solicitation, bids may be submitted by facsimile. The only acceptable facsimile number for responses to bid solicitations issued by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> headquarters is 819-997-9776. The facsimile number for responses to bid solicitations issued by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> regional offices is identified in the bid solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) If the Bidder submits a bid by facsimile, Canada will not be responsible for any failure attributable to the transmission or receipt of the faxed bid including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>receipt of garbled or incomplete bid;</li>
<li>availability or condition of the receiving facsimile equipment;</li>
<li>incompatibility between the sending and receiving equipment;</li>
<li>delay in transmission or receipt of the bid;</li>
<li>failure of the Bidder to properly identify the bid;</li>
<li>illegibility of the bid; or </li>
<li>security of bid data.</li>
</ol>
<p>(3) Bids submitted by facsimile will constitute the formal bid of the Bidder and must be submitted in accordance with section 3, Submission of Bids. For responses transmitted by facsimile, written confirmation is required within two (2) working days after bid closing, unless otherwise specified in the solicitation. All documents confirming bids should bear the word 'CONFIRMATION'.</p>
<h4>07. Customs Clearance</h4>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Bidder to allow sufficient time to obtain customs clearance, where required, before the bid closing date and time. Delays related to the obtaining of customs clearance cannot be construed as 'undue delay in the mail' and will not be accepted as a delayed bid under Section 5, Delayed Bids.</p>
<h4>08. Legal Capacity</h4>
<p>The Bidder must have the legal capacity to contract. If the Bidder is a sole proprietorship, a partnership or a corporate body, the Bidder must provide, if requested by the Contracting Authority, a statement and any requested supporting documentation indicating the laws under which it is registered or incorporated together with the registered or corporate name and place of business. This also applies to bidders submitting a bid as a joint venture.</p>
<h4>09. Rights of Canada</h4>
<p>Canada reserves the right to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>reject any or all bids received in response to the bid solicitation;</li>
<li>enter into negotiations with bidders on any or all aspects of their bids;</li>
<li>accept any bid in whole or in part without negotiations;</li>
<li>cancel the bid solicitation at any time; </li>
<li>reissue the bid solicitation; </li>
<li>if no compliant bids are received and the requirement is not substantially modified, re-tender the requirement by inviting only the bidders who bid to re-submit bids within a period designated by Canada; and, </li>
<li>negotiate with the sole compliant Bidder to ensure best value to Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h4>10. Vendor Performance</h4>
<p>(1) Canada may reject a bid where any of the following circumstances is present:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>the Bidder, or any employee or subcontractor included as part of the bid, has been convicted under Section 121 (Frauds on the government &amp; Contractor subscribing to election fund), Section 124 (Selling or purchasing office), or Section 418 (Selling defective stores to Her Majesty) of the Criminal Code; or,</li>
<li>the Bidder is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Policy, which renders the Bidder ineligible to bid on the requirement;</li>
<li>an employee or subcontractor included as part of the bid, is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Policy, which would render that employee or subcontractor ineligible to bid on the requirement, or the portion of the requirement the employee or subcontractor is to perform;</li>
<li>with respect to current or prior transactions with the Government of Canada<br/>
<ol type="i">
<li>the Bidder is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>
<li>evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law protecting individuals against any manner of discrimination, has been received with respect to the Bidder, any of its employees or any subcontractor included as part of its bid;</li>
<li>Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of suspension or termination for default with respect to a contract with the Bidder,<br/>
                  any of its employees or any subcontractor included as part of its bid;</li>
<li>Canada determines that the Bidder's performance on other contracts, including the efficiency and workmanship as well as the extent to which the Bidder executed the requirement in accordance with contractual terms and conditions, is sufficiently poor to jeopardize the successful completion of the requirement being bid on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(2) Where Canada intends to reject a bid pursuant to a provision of paragraph 1, other than 1(b), the Contracting Authority will so inform the Bidder and provide the Bidder ten (10) days within which to make representations, prior to making a final decision on the bid rejection.</p>
<h4>11. Communications - Solicitation Period</h4>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the competitive bid process, enquiries and other communications regarding the bid solicitation, must be directed, in writing, ONLY to the Contracting Authority identified in the bid solicitation. Failure to comply can (for that reason alone) result in the disqualification of the bid.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to bidders, significant enquiries received and the replies to such enquiries will be provided simultaneously to bidders to which the bid solicitation has been sent, without revealing the sources of the enquiries.</p>
<h4>12. Price Support</h4>
<p>In the event that the Bidder's bid is the sole responsive bid received, the Bidder must provide, on Canada's request, one or more of the following price support if applicable: </p>
<ol type="a">
<li>a current published price list indicating the percentage discount available to Public Works and Government Services Canada; </li>
<li>copies of paid invoices for like services performed for other customers or for like items (same quantity and quality) sold to other customers; </li>
<li>a price breakdown showing the cost of direct labour, direct materials, purchased items, engineering and plant overheads, general and administrative overhead, transportation, profit, etc.; </li>
<li>a price or rate certifications;</li>
<li>any other supporting documentation as requested by Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h4>13. Bid Costs </h4>
<p>No payment will be made for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a bid in response to the bid solicitation. Costs associated with preparing and submitting a bid as well as any costs incurred by the Bidder associated with the evaluation of the bid, are the sole responsibility of the Bidder.</p>
<h4>14. Further Information</h4>
<p>(1) For further information, bidders may contact the Contracting Authority identified in the bid solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) For bid solicitations issued out of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> headquarters, enquiries concerning receipt of bids may be addressed to the Bid Receiving Unit, Procurement Operational Support Division, telephone 819-956-3370. For bid solicitations issued out of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> regional offices, enquiries concerning receipt of bids may be addressed to the Contracting Authority identified in the bid solicitation.</p>

<h4>2029 01 (2005-06-10) Interpretation</h4>
<p>In the Contract, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>
<p>'Contract' means the written agreement between the Parties, these general conditions, any referenced conditions and clauses, and any other document specified or referred to as forming part of the Contract, all as amended by agreement of the Parties from time to time;</p>
<p>'Contractor' means the person or entity whose name appears on the signature page of the written agreement and who is to supply goods or services to Canada under the Contract;</p>
<p>'Government Property' means anything supplied to the Contractor by or on behalf of Canada for the purposes of performing the Contract and anything acquired by the Contractor in any manner in connection with the Work the cost of which is paid by Canada under the Contract;</p>
<p>'Minister' means the Minister of Public Works and Government Services and any other person duly authorized to act on behalf of that Minister;</p>
<p>'Work' means the whole of the activities, services, goods, equipment, matters and things required to be done, delivered or performed by the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the Contract.</p>
<h4>2029 02 (2005-06-10) Standard Conditions and Clauses</h4>
<p>Pursuant to the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act, S.C. 1996, c.16, the conditions and clauses identified by title, number and a date in the Contract are incorporated by reference and form part of the Contract as though expressly set out in the Contract.</p>
<h4>2029 03 (2005-06-10) Status of the Contractor</h4>
<p>The Contractor is engaged as an independent Contractor for the sole purpose of performing the Work. Neither the Contractor nor any of its personnel is engaged as an employee, servant or agent of Canada. The Contractor is responsible for all deductions and remittances required by law in relation to its employees. </p>
<h4>2029 04 (2005-06-10) Inspection, Acceptance and Warranty</h4>
<p>The Contractor must perform the Work efficiently in accordance with standards of quality acceptable to Canada and in full conformity with all the requirements of the Contract.</p>
<p>The Work is subject to inspection and acceptance by Canada. Despite prior acceptance of the Work and without restricting any conditions or warranty imposed by law, the Contractor, if requested by the Minister to do so, must replace, repair or correct, at its option and its own expense any Work which becomes defective or which fails to conform to the Contract requirements, where applicable. For goods, the warranty period will be twelve (12) months after delivery and acceptance of the Work or the length of the Contractor's or manufacturer's standard warranty period, whichever is longer. Any Work replaced, repaired or corrected pursuant to this section is subject to all provisions of the Contract to the same extent as Work initially performed.</p>
<p>Canada must pay the transportation cost associated with returning any Work to the Contractor for replacement, repair or making good and the Contractor must pay the transportation cost associated with forwarding the replacement or returning the Work to the delivery point specified in the Contract or to another location as directed by Canada. If, in the opinion of the Minister, it is not expedient to remove the Work from its location, the Contractor must carry out any necessary repair or making good of the Work at that location and will be paid its reasonable travelling and living expenses.</p>
<h4>2029 05 (2005-06-10) Invoice Submission</h4>

They must show the name and address of the client department, item/reference number, deliverable and/or description of Work, contract serial number, Client Reference Number (CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN) and financial code(s). If applicable, the method of shipment together with date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, item, quantity, unit of issue, unit price, and additional charges will be shown on the invoice. If applicable, fixed time labour rates, level of effort and, the amount invoiced (exclusive of the Goods and Services Tax {GST} or Harmonized Sales Tax {HST} as appropriate), will be shown separately.</p>
<p>GST, HST or other taxes, if applicable, will be incorporated into all invoices and shown as a separate item on invoices. All goods or services that are zero-rated, exempt or to which the GST or HST does not apply, are to be identified as such on all invoices. Invoices must be submitted for each delivery/shipment and must apply to one contract only. Each invoice must indicate whether it covers partial or final delivery.</p>
<h4>2029 06 (2005-06-10) Taxes</h4>
<p>(1) Municipal Taxes <br/>
            Municipal Taxes are not applicable.</p>
<p>(2) Provincial Taxes</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Excluding legislated exceptions, federal government departments and agencies are not required to pay any ad valorem sales tax levied by the province in which the taxable goods or services are delivered. This exemption has been provided to federal government departments and agencies under the authority of one of the following:<br/>
<ol type="i">
<li>Provincial Sales Tax (PST) Exemption Licence Numbers, for the provinces of:
<p> Prince Edward Island OP-10000-250<br/>
                    Ontario 11708174G<br/>
                    Manitoba 390-516-0<br/>
                    British Columbia R005521</p>
</li>
<li>For Quebec, Saskatchewan, the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, an Exemption Certification, which certifies that the goods or services purchased are not subject to the provincial/territorial sales and consumption taxes because they are being purchased by the federal government with Canada funds for the use of the federal government.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Currently, in Alberta, the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, there is no general PST. However, should a PST be introduced in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, or Yukon Territory, the sales tax exemption certificate would be required on the purchasing document.</li>
<li>Federal departments are required to pay the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) in the participating provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.</li>
<li>The Contractor is not exempt from paying PST under the above Exemption Licence Numbers or Exemption Certification. The Contractor is required to pay the PST on taxable goods or services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract (as per appropriate provincial legislation), including material incorporated into real property.</li>
</ol>
<p>(3) Changes to Taxes and Duties<br/>
            In the event of any change in any tax imposed under the Excise Act, R.S.C 1985, c. E-14 and Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15 or any duties imposed under the Customs Tariff or any other federal or provincial sales, excise or other like duties, taxes, charges or impositions after the bid submission date and which affects the costs of the Work to the Contractor, the Contract price will be adjusted to reflect the increase or decrease in the cost to the Contractor.</p>
<p>(4) Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax<br/>
            The estimated Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), if applicable, is included in the total estimated cost on page 1 of the Contract. The GST or HST is not included in the Contract price but will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission clause above. The Contractor agrees to remit to Canada Revenue Agency any amounts of GST and HST paid or due.</p>
<h4>2029 07 (2005-06-10) Transportation Charges </h4>
<p>If transportation charges are payable by Canada under the terms of the Contract and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent with normal shipping practice. The charges must be shown as a separate item on the invoice. The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for transportation beyond the point at which title of goods passes to the federal government (determined by the FOB point or Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for shipment.</p>
<h4>2029 08 (2005-06-10) Shipment Documentation</h4>
<p>For the shipment of goods, the transportation bill of lading must accompany the original invoice, except for 'collect' shipments (if and when stipulated), in which event it must accompany the shipment. In addition, a packing slip must accompany each shipment, showing item, quantity, part or reference numbers, description of suppliers and contract reference numbers, including the Client Reference Number (CRN) and Procurement Business Number (PBN). If the goods have been inspected at the Contractor's plant, the signed inspection voucher must be attached to the packing slip normally enclosed in the packing note envelope.</p>
<h4>2029 09 (2005-06-10) Payment and Interest on Overdue Accounts</h4>
<p> Payment by Canada for the Work will be made following delivery, inspection and acceptance of the Work, and upon presentation of invoices and any other substantiating documentation as Canada requires. </p>
<p>(1) For the purposes of this section:</p>
<p>'Average Rate' means the simple arithmetic mean of the Bank Rates in effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each day during the calendar month which immediately precedes the calendar month in which payment is made;</p>
<p>'Bank Rate' means the rate of interest established from time to time by the Bank of Canada as the minimum rate at which the Bank of Canada makes short term advances to members of the Canadian Payments Association;</p>
<p>'date of payment' means the date of the negotiable instrument drawn by the Receiver General for Canada and given for payment of an amount due and payable under the Contract;</p>
<p>an amount becomes 'overdue' when it is unpaid on the first day following the day upon which it is due and payable in accordance with the terms of the Contract.</p>
<p>(2) Canada is liable to pay to the Contractor simple interest at the Average Rate plus three percent (3%) per annum on any amount that is overdue, from the date such amount becomes overdue until the day prior to the date of payment, inclusive. Interest will be paid without notice from the Contractor.</p>
<p>(3) Canada is not liable to pay interest in accordance with this section if Canada is not responsible for the delay in paying the Contractor. Canada is not liable to pay interest on overdue advance payments. </p>
<h4>2029 10 (2005-06-10) Audit</h4>
<p>The amount claimed by the Contractor under the Contract is subject to audit by Canada before or after payment has been made to the Contractor. The Contractor must keep proper accounts and records of the cost of performing the Contract and keep all documents relating to such cost for a period of 6 years after final payment under the Contract.</p>
<h4>2029 11 (2005-06-10) Compliance with Applicable Laws</h4>
<p>The Contractor must comply with all laws applicable to the performance of the Work.</p>
<h4>2029 12 (2005-06-10) Time of the Essence</h4>
<p>The Work must be performed within or at the time stated in the Contract.</p>
<h4>2029 13 (2005-06-10) Title</h4>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, title to the Work (including copyright where it exists) belongs to Canada upon delivery and acceptance by Canada and the risk of loss or damage remains with the Contractor until delivery of the Work to Canada.</p>
<h4>2029 14 (2005-06-10) Government Property</h4>
<p>The Contractor must take reasonable and proper care of all Government Property while such property is in its possession or subject to its control and is responsible for any loss or damage, ordinary wear and tear excepted, resulting from its failure to do so.</p>
<h4>2029 15 (2005-06-10) Amendment and Assignment </h4>
<p>The Contract must not be amended or assigned, in whole or in part, without the prior written agreement of the parties.</p>
<h4>2029 16 (2005-06-10) Default by the Contractor</h4>
<p>If the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of its obligations under the Contract, or is bankrupt or insolvent or in receivership, the Minister may, upon giving written notice to the Contractor, terminate the whole or any part of the Contract. Upon the giving of such notice, the Contractor will have no claim for any further payment and remains liable to Canada for all losses and damages suffered by Canada by reason of the default, including any increase in the cost incurred by Canada in procuring the Work from another source.</p>
<h4>2029 17 (2005-06-10) Termination for Convenience</h4>
<p>The Minister may, any time prior to the completion of the Work, by giving notice to the Contractor in writing, terminate all or any portion of the Contract. In such case, the Contractor will be paid for Work that has been performed, accepted and unpaid in accordance with the Contract price. The Contractor will be entitled to be reimbursed the actual costs reasonably and properly incurred as a direct result of the termination, but in no case such reimbursement must exceed the Contract price. The Contractor will have no claim for damages, compensation, loss of profit or otherwise, except as provided in this section.</p>
<h4>2029 18 (2005-06-10) Members of the House of Commons</h4>
<p>Members of the House of Commons are not admitted to any share or part of the Contract or to any benefit resulting from the Contract.</p>

<h4>2010 02 (2005-06-10) Standard Conditions and Clauses</h4>
<p>Pursuant to the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act, S.C. 1996, c. 16, the conditions and clauses identified by title, number and date in the Contract are incorporated by reference into and form part of the Contract as though expressly set out in the Contract.</p>
<h4>2010 03 (2005-06-10) Status of the Contractor</h4>
<p>The Contractor is engaged as an independent Contractor for the sole purpose of performing the Work. Neither the Contractor nor any of its personnel is engaged as an employee, servant or agent of Canada. The Contractor is responsible for all deductions and remittances required by law in relation to its employees.</p>
<h4>2010 04 (2005-06-10) Conduct of the Work</h4>
<p>(1) The Contractor represents and warrants that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>it is competent to perform the Work; and</li>
<li>it has the necessary qualifications, including knowledge and skill, to perform the Work.</li>
</ol>
<p>(2) The Contractor must:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>supply everything necessary for the performance of the Work;</li>
<li>carry out the Work in a diligent and efficient manner; and</li>
<li>perform the Work in accordance with standards of quality acceptable to Canada and in full conformity with the requirements of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<h4>2010 05 (2005-06-10) Subcontracts</h4>
<p>(1) The Contractor may subcontract the supply of standard goods or services which are customarily subcontracted by the Contractor. In any other instance, the Contractor must obtain the prior consent in writing of the Minister. The Minister may require the Contractor to furnish such particulars of the proposed Subcontract as he deems necessary.</p>
<p>(2) Subcontracting does not relieve the Contractor from any of its obligations under the Contract or impose any liability upon Canada or the Minister to a subcontractor.</p>
<p>(3) In any Subcontract, the Contractor agrees to bind the subcontractor by the same terms and conditions by which the Contractor is bound under the Contract, unless the Minister requires or agrees otherwise.</p>
<h4>2010 06 (2005-06-10) Excusable Delay</h4>
<p>(1) A delay in the performance by the Contractor of any obligation under the Contract which is caused solely by an event that</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>was beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor,</li>
<li>could not reasonably have been foreseen,</li>
<li>could not reasonably have been prevented by means reasonably available to the Contractor, and</li>
<li>occurred without the fault or neglect of the Contractor,</li>
</ol>
<p>constitutes an 'Excusable Delay' provided that the Contractor advises the Minister of the occurrence of the delay or of the likelihood of the delay occurring as soon as the Contractor becomes aware of it. The Contractor must further advise the Minister, within 15 working day, of the full facts or matters giving rise to the delay and provide to the Minister for approval a clear work-around plan indicating in detail the steps that the Contractor proposes to take in order to minimize the impact of the event causing the delay.</p>
<p>(2) In the event of an Excusable Delay, any delivery date or other date that is directly affected will be postponed for a reasonable time not to exceed the duration of the Excusable Delay.</p>
<p>(3) The Minister may, however, after an Excusable Delay has continued for 30 days or more, in the Minister's absolute discretion, terminate the Contract. In such a case, the Parties agree that neither will make any claim against the other for damages, costs, expected profits or any other loss arising out of the termination or the event that gave rise to the Excusable Delay. The Contractor agrees to repay immediately to Canada the portion of any advance payment that is unliquidated at the date of the termination.</p>
<p>(4) Except to the extent that Canada is responsible for the delay for reasons of failure to meet an obligation under the Contract, Canada is not liable for any costs or charges of any nature incurred by the Contractor or any of its subcontractors or agents as a result of an Excusable Delay.</p>
<p>(5) Upon termination of the Contract under this section, the Minister may require the Contractor to deliver to Canada, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Minister, any completed parts of the Work which have not been delivered and accepted prior to the termination and any materials, parts, plant, equipment or work-in-process which the Contractor has acquired or produced specifically in the fulfillment of the Contract. Canada will pay the Contractor the value, determined on the basis of the Contract Price, including the proportionate part of the Contractor's profit or fee included in the Contract Price, of all completed parts of the Work and the Cost to the Contractor that the Minister considers reasonable in respect of all materials, parts, plant, equipment or work-in-process delivered to Canada and accepted by Canada. In no event will the aggregate of the amounts paid by Canada under the Contract to the date of termination and any amounts payable pursuant to this subsection exceed the Contract Price.</p>
<h4>2010 07 (2005-06-10) Inspection, Acceptance and Warranty</h4>
<p>The Work is subject to inspection and acceptance by Canada. Despite prior acceptance of the Work and without restricting any conditions or warranty imposed by law, the Contractor, if requested by the Minister to do so, must replace, repair or correct at its option and its own expense any Work which becomes defective or which fails to conform to the Contract requirements, where applicable. For goods, the warranty period will be twelve (12) months after delivery and acceptance or the length of the Contractor's or manufacturer's standard warranty period, whichever is longer. Any Work replaced, repaired or corrected pursuant to this section is subject to all provisions of the contract to the same extent as Work initially performed.</p>
<p>Canada must pay the transportation cost associated with returning any Work to the Contractor for replacement, repair or making good and the Contractor must pay the transportation cost associated with forwarding the replacement or returning the Work to the delivery point specified in the Contract or to another location as directed by Canada. If, in the opinion of the Minister, it is not expedient to remove the Work from its location, the Contractor must carry out any necessary repair or making good of the Work at that location and will be paid its reasonable travelling and living expenses.</p>
<h4>2010 08 (2005-06-10) Invoice Submission</h4>
<p>Invoices must be submitted in the name of the Contractor. They must show the name and address of the client department, item/reference number, deliverable and/or description of Work, contract serial number, Client Reference Number (CRN), Procurement Business Number (PBN) and financial code(s). If applicable, the method of shipment together with date, case numbers and part or reference numbers, item, quantity, unit of issue, unit price, and additional charges will be shown on the invoice. If applicable, fixed time labour rates and level of effort and, the amount invoiced (exclusive of the Goods and Services Tax {GST} or Harmonized Sales Tax {HST} as appropriate), will be shown separately.</p>
<p>GST or HST, if applicable, will be incorporated into all invoices and shown as a separate item on invoices. All items that are zero-rated, exempt or to which the GST or HST does not apply, are to be identified as such on all invoices. Invoices must be submitted for each delivery/shipment and must apply to one contract only. Each invoice must indicate whether it covers partial or final delivery.</p>
<h4>2010 09 (2005-06-10) Taxes</h4>
<p>(1) Municipal Taxes <br/>
            Municipal Taxes are not applicable.</p>
<p>(2) Provincial Taxes</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Excluding legislated exceptions, federal government departments and agencies are not required to pay any ad valorem sales tax levied by the province in which the taxable goods or services are delivered. This exemption has been provided to federal government departments and agencies under the authority of one of the following:<br/>
<ol type="i">
<li>(i) Provincial Sales Tax (PST) Exemption Licence Numbers, for the provinces of:
<p> Prince Edward Island OP-10000-250<br/>
                    Ontario 11708174G<br/>
                    Manitoba 390-516-0<br/>
                    British Columbia R005521</p>
</li>
<li>For Quebec, Saskatchewan, the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, an Exemption Certification, which certifies that the goods or services purchased are not subject to the provincial/territorial sales and consumption taxes because they are being purchased by the federal government with Canada funds for the use of the federal government.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Currently, in Alberta, the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, there is no general PST. However, should a PST be introduced in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, or Yukon Territory, the sales tax exemption certificate would be required on the purchasing document.</li>
<li>Federal departments are required to pay the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) in the participating provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.</li>
<li>The Contractor is not exempt from paying PST under the above Exemption Licence Numbers or Exemption Certification. The Contractor is required to pay the PST on taxable goods or services used or consumed in the performance of the Contract (as per appropriate provincial legislation), including material incorporated into real property.</li>
</ol>
<p>(3) Changes to Taxes and Duties<br/>
            In the event of any change in any tax imposed under the Excise Act, R.S.C 1985, c. E-14 and Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15 or any duties imposed under the Customs Tariff or any other federal or provincial sales, excise or other like duties, taxes, charges or impositions after the bid submission date and which affects the costs of the Work to the Contractor, the Contract price will be adjusted to reflect the increase or decrease in the cost to the Contractor.</p>
<p>(4) Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax<br/>
            The estimated Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), if applicable, is included in the total estimated cost on page 1 of the Contract. The GST or HST is not included in the Contract price but will be paid by Canada as provided in the Invoice Submission clause above. The Contractor agrees to remit to Canada Revenue Agency any amounts of GST and HST paid or due.</p>
<h4> 2010 10 (2005-06-10) Transportation Charges</h4>
<p>If transportation charges are payable by Canada under the terms of the Contract and the Contractor makes the transportation arrangements, shipments must be made by the most direct and economical means consistent with normal shipping practice. The charges must be shown as a separate item on the invoice. The federal government's policy of underwriting its own risks precludes payment of insurance or valuation charges for transportation beyond the point at which title of goods passes to the federal government (determined by the FOB point or Incoterms). Where increased carrier liability is available without charge, the Contractor must obtain the increased liability for shipment.</p>
<h4>2010 11 (2005-06-10) Shipment Documentation</h4>
<p>For the shipment of goods, the transportation bill of lading must accompany the original invoice, except for 'collect' shipments (if and when stipulated), in which event it must accompany the shipment. In addition, a packing slip must accompany each shipment, showing item, quantity, part or reference numbers, description of suppliers and contract reference numbers, including the Client Reference Number (CRN) and Procurement Business Number (PBN). If the goods have been inspected at the Contractor's plant, the signed inspection voucher must be attached to the packing slip normally enclosed in the packing note envelope.</p>
<h4>2010 12 (2005-06-10) Payment</h4>
<p>Payment by Canada for the Work will be made following delivery, inspection and acceptance of the Work, and upon presentation of invoices and any other substantiating documentation as Canada requires. </p>
<h4>2010 13 (2005-06-10) Interest on Overdue Accounts</h4>
<p>(1) For the purposes of this section:</p>
<p>'Average Rate' means the simple arithmetic mean of the Bank Rates in effect at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each day during the calendar month which immediately precedes the calendar month in which payment is made;</p>
<p>'Bank Rate' means the rate of interest established from time to time by the Bank of Canada as the minimum rate at which the Bank of Canada makes short term advances to members of the Canadian Payments Association;</p>
<p>'date of payment' means the date of the negotiable instrument drawn by the Receiver General for Canada and given for payment of an amount due and payable under the Contract;</p>
<p>an amount becomes 'overdue' when it is unpaid on the first day following the day upon which it is due and payable in accordance with the terms of the Contract.</p>
<p>(2) Canada is liable to pay to the Contractor simple interest at the Average Rate plus three percent (3%) per annum on any amount that is overdue, from the date such amount becomes overdue until the day prior to the date of payment, inclusive. Interest will be paid without notice from the Contractor.</p>
<p>(3) Canada is not liable to pay interest in accordance with this section if Canada is not responsible for the delay in paying the Contractor. Canada is not liable to pay interest on overdue advance payments. </p>
<h4>2010 14 (2005-06-10) Audit</h4>
<p>(1) The Contractor must keep proper accounts and records of the Cost to the Contractor of the Work and of all expenditures or commitments made by the Contractor in connection with the Work and must keep all invoices, receipts and vouchers relating to the Work. The Contractor must not, without the prior written consent of the Minister, dispose of any such accounts, records, invoices, receipts or vouchers until the expiration of 6 years after final payment under the Contract, or until the settlement of all outstanding claims and disputes, whichever is later.</p>
<p>(2) All such accounts and records as well as any invoices, receipts and vouchers must at all times during the retention period referred to in subsection 1 be open to audit, inspection and examination by the authorized representatives of the Minister, who may make copies and take extracts. The Contractor must provide all facilities for such audits and inspections and must furnish all such information as the representatives of the Minister may from time to time require with respect to such accounts, records, invoices, receipts and vouchers.</p>
<h4>2010 15 (2005-06-10) Compliance with Applicable Laws</h4>
<p>The Contractor must comply with all laws applicable to the performance of the Work.</p>
<h4>2010 16 (2005-06-10) Time of the Essence</h4>
<p>The Work must be performed within or at the time stated in the Contract.</p>
<h4>2010 17 (2005-06-10) Title</h4>
<p>(1) Except as otherwise provided in the Contract, and except as provided in subsection 2, title of the Work or any part of the Work belongs to Canada upon delivery and acceptance by or on behalf of Canada.</p>
<p>(2) If any payment is made to the Contractor for or on account of materials, parts, work-in-process or finished work, either by way of progress payments or accountable advances or otherwise, title in and to all materials, parts, work-in-process and finished work so paid for belongs to Canada upon payment. Transfer pursuant to this subsection does not constitute acceptance by Canada of the materials, parts, work-in-process or finished work, and does not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to perform the Work in accordance with the Contract.</p>
<p>(3) Despite any transfer of title referred to in this section and except as otherwise provided in the Contract, the risk of loss or damage to the materials, parts, work-in-process or finished Work remains with the Contractor until their delivery to Canada in accordance with the Contract.</p>
<p>(4) Where title to any materials, parts, work-in-process or finished Work is transferred to Canada, the Contractor must, upon the Minister's request, establish to the Minister's satisfaction that the title is free and clear of all claims, liens, attachments, charges or encumbrances and must execute such conveyances and other instruments necessary to perfect that title as the Minister may request.</p>
<h4>2010 18 (2005-06-10) Confidentiality</h4>
<p>(1) The Contractor must keep confidential all information provided to the Contractor by or on behalf of Canada in connection with the Work and all information conceived, developed or produced by the Contractor as part of the Work. Information provided to the Contractor by or on behalf of Canada must be used solely for the purpose of the Contract and remains the property of Canada.</p>
<p>(2) Subject to the Access to Information Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1 and to any right of Canada under the Contract to release or disclose, Canada agrees not to release or disclose outside the Government of Canada any information delivered to Canada under the Contract that is proprietary to the Contractor or a subcontractor.</p>
<p>(3) The obligations of the Parties set out in this section do not apply to any information where the same information:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>is publicly available from a source other than the other Party; or</li>
<li>is or becomes known to a Party from a source other than the other Party, except any source that is known to be under an obligation to the other Party not to disclose the information, or</li>
<li>is developed by a Party without use of the information of the other Party.</li>
</ol>
<h4>2010 19 (2005-06-10) Copyright</h4>
<p>(1) Anything that is created or developed by the Contractor as part of the Work under the Contract in which copyright subsists belongs to Canada. The Contractor must incorporate the copyright symbol and either of the following notices, as appropriate:</p>
<p>HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA (year)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>SA MAJESTÉ LA REINE DU CHEF DU CANADA (année)</p>
<p>(2) At the request of the Minister, the Contractor must provide to Canada, at the completion of the Work or at such other time as the Minister may require, a written permanent waiver of Moral Rights, in a form acceptable to the Minister, from every author that contributed to the Work. If the Contractor is an author, the Contractor permanently waives the Contractor's Moral Rights.</p>
<h4>2010 20 (2005-06-10) Government Property</h4>
<p>The Contractor must take reasonable and proper care of all Government Property while such property is in its possession or subject to its control and is responsible for any loss or damage, ordinary wear and tear excepted, resulting from its failure to do so.</p>
<h4>2010 21 (2005-06-10) Amendment</h4>
<p>No amendment to the Contract is effective unless it is incorporated into the Contract by written amendment executed by the authorized representatives of the Minister and of the Contractor. </p>
<h4>2010 22 (2005-06-10) Assignment</h4>
<p>(1) The Contract must not be assigned, in whole or in part, by the Contractor without the prior consent in writing of the Minister and any assignment made without that consent is void and of no effect.</p>
<p>(2) Assignment of the Contract does not relieve the Contractor from any obligation under the Contract or impose any liability upon Canada or the Minister, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Minister.</p>
<h4>2010 23 (2005-06-10) Default by the Contractor</h4>
<p>(1) Where the Contractor is in default in carrying out any of its obligations under the Contract, the Minister may, upon giving written notice to the Contractor, terminate for default the whole or any part of the Contract, either immediately, or at the expiration of a cure period specified in the notice if the Contractor has not cured the default to the satisfaction of the Minister within that cure period.</p>
<p>(2) Where the Contractor becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or takes the benefit of any statute relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors, or where a receiver is appointed under a debt instrument or a receiving order is made against the Contractor, or an order is made or a resolution passed for the winding up of the Contractor, the Minister may, upon giving notice to the Contractor, immediately terminate for default the whole or any part of the Contract.</p>
<p>(3) Upon the giving of a notice provided for in subsection 1 or 2, the Contractor will have no claim for further payment, but remains liable to Canada for any amounts, including milestone payments, paid by Canada and for all losses and damages which may be suffered by Canada by reason of the default, including any increase in the cost incurred by Canada in procuring the Work from another source.</p>
<p>(4) Upon termination of the Contract under this section, the Minister may require the Contractor to deliver to Canada, in the manner and to the extent directed by the Minister, any completed parts of the Work which have not been delivered and accepted prior to the termination and any materials, parts, plant, equipment or work-in-process which the Contractor has acquired or produced specifically in the fulfillment of the Contract.</p>
<p>(5) Subject to the deduction of any claim that Canada may have against the Contractor arising under the Contract or out of the termination, Canada will pay the Contractor the value, determined on the basis of the Contract Price including the proportionate part of the Contractor's profit or fee included in the Contract Price, of all completed parts of the Work and the Cost to the Contractor that the Minister considers reasonable in respect of all materials, parts, plant, equipment or work-in-process delivered to Canada pursuant to a direction under subsection 4 and accepted by Canada.</p>
<h4>2010 24 (2005-06-10) Termination for Convenience</h4>
<p>(1) The Minister may, at any time prior to the completion of the Work, by giving notice to the Contractor in writing, terminate the Contract as regards all or any part of the Work not completed. Upon a termination notice being given, the Contractor must cease Work in accordance with and to the extent specified in the notice, but must proceed to complete such part or parts of the Work as are not affected by the termination notice.</p>
<p>(2) In the event of a termination notice being given pursuant to subsection 1, the Contractor will be entitled to be paid, to the extent that costs have been reasonably and properly incurred for purposes of performing the Contract and to the extent that the Contractor has not already been so paid or reimbursed by Canada:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>on the basis of the Contract Price, for all completed Work that is accepted in accordance with the Contract, whether completed before, or after and in compliance with the instructions contained in the termination notice;</li>
<li>the Cost to the Contractor plus a fair and reasonable profit, for all Work terminated by the termination notice before completion, the Cost to the Contractor being determined in accordance with the terms of the Contract and with Contract Cost Principles, 1031-2;</li>
<li>all costs of and incidental to the termination of the Work, but not including the cost of severance payments or damages to employees whose services are no longer required by reason of the termination except wages that the Contractor is obligated by statute to pay them and except for reasonable severance payments or damages paid to employees hired to perform the Contract whose hiring was expressly required by the Contract or approved in writing by the Minister for the purpose of the Contract.</li>
</ol>
<p>(3) The Minister may reduce the payment in respect of any of the Work to the extent that, upon inspection, it is deficient in meeting the requirements of the Contract.</p>
<p>(4) The total of the amounts to which the Contractor is entitled under subsections 2(a) and (b), together with any amounts paid or due or becoming due to the Contractor under other provisions of the Contract, must not exceed the Contract Price or the portion that is applicable to the part of the Work that is terminated.</p>
<p>(5) The Contractor has no claim for damages, compensation, loss of profit, allowance or otherwise by reason of, or directly or indirectly arising out of, any action taken or termination notice given by the Minister under this section, except to the extent that this section expressly provides.</p>

<p>(1) Persons in Canada, and Canadians outside of Canada, are bound by economic sanctions imposed by Canada. As a result, the Government of Canada cannot accept delivery of goods or services that originate, either directly or indirectly, from the countries or persons subject to economic sanctions.</p>
<p>Details on existing sanctions can be found at:<br/>
<a href="http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/trade/sanctions-e.asp" rel="external">http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/trade/sanctions-e.asp</a></p>
<p>(2) The Contractor must not supply to the Government of Canada any goods or services which are subject to economic sanctions.</p>
<p>(3) By law, the Contractor must comply with changes to the regulations imposed during the life of the Contract. During the performance of the Contract, should the imposition of sanctions against a country or person or the addition of a good or service to the list of sanctioned goods or services cause an impossibility of performance for the Contractor, the situation will be treated by the Parties as a force majeure. The Contractor must immediately inform Canada of the situation and the procedures applicable to force majeure will then apply.</p>
<h4>2010 29 (2005-06-10) Entire Agreement</h4>

<h4>Chapter 6 - Developing the Procurement Strategy</h4>
<p><strong>Section 6E: Process</strong></p>
<p><strong>Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement Templates</strong></p>
<p>6E.643 (2005-06-10) Public Works and Government Services Canada (<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>) has implemented Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement Templates including new standard instructions and new general conditions for use by its contracting officers for the procurement of goods or services (excluding construction). </p>
<p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> contracting officers must use the Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement documents for Low Dollar Value (LDV) and Medium Complexity requirements for goods or services for competitive or non-competitive requirements.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a 'common look and feel' for the Department's procurement documents, contracting officers must not modify or change the order and content of these standard templates except where indicated.</p>
<p>Please direct inquiries to Gaëtane Dagenais, Procurement Process Tools Division gaë<a href="mailto:tane.dagenais@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca" rel="external">tane.dagenais@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2T-PROC1 Procedures for Using the Low Dollar Value And Medium Complexity Templates</strong></p>
<p>Contracting Officers must use the Low Dollar Value (LDV) and the Medium Complexity documents in accordance with these procedures.</p>
<p><strong>LDV and Medium Complexity Competitive and Non Competitive requirements</strong></p>
<p>Plain Language Standard Procurement Templates as well as standard Instructions and general Conditions have been developed in consultation with Public Works and Government Services Canada (<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>) Legal Services and must be used for standard, well defined requirements for goods or services in a competitive or non-competitive (sole source) environment. 2003 Standard Instructions - Goods or Services is to be used in lieu of Standard Instructions and Conditions 9403 and 9403-5, for LDV and Medium Complexity requirements. 2029 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Low Dollar Value) is to be used in lieu of General Conditions 9329 and General Conditions 9628 for LDV requirements. 2010 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Medium Complexity) is to be used in lieu of General Conditions 9601-10. Standard Instructions and Conditions 9403 and 9403-5 will remain active in the Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual for use with requirements other than LDV and Medium Complexity requirements. General Conditions 9628, 9329 and 9601-10 will be cancelled effective June 10, 2005.</p>
<p>SACC Manual clauses may be added to the bid solicitation and contract templates as necessary for the requirement and provided they are not already included in the new 2003 Standard Instructions - Good or Services, the new 2029 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Low Dollar Value) or the new 2010 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Medium Complexity). Contracting officers may add additional clauses, as applicable, in the templates as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clauses must be incorporated by reference under 'SACC Manual Clauses' provided in the different sections of the templates unless there are blanks to be filled in. While incorporating SACC clauses by reference may be contrary to current procedures identified under the Remarks section of the SACC Manual, this approach is recommended by Legal and must be followed when using the Plain Language Templates;</li>
<li>Clauses with blanks must be added in full text, within the appropriate section in the templates;</li>
<li>Other pertinent clauses may be added within the appropriate section to address commodity requirements in the templates as required; and,</li>
<li>Annexes may be added for specific commodity needs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>TEMPLATES </h4>
<p><strong><em>1. 2T- LDV1 Low Dollar Value Bid Solicitation and Resulting Contract Template - Goods or Services:</em></strong> The Bid Solicitation template includes the new 2003 Standard Instructions - Goods or Services incorporated by reference. The Contract template includes the new 2029 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Low Dollar Value), incorporated by reference. The Contract template will also apply when quotes are obtained through Request for Quotations (RFQ) or telephone buys for competitive requirements and the lowest price bid is accepted; or, when a quote is obtained through an RFQ or a telephone buy for non-competitive sole source requirements. Where the Bid Solicitation is not used, delete Part 1 and the title 'Part 2 - Resulting Contract Clauses' before use.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. 2T- MED1 Medium Complexity Bid Solicitation and Resulting Contract Template - Goods or Services:</strong></em> The Bid Solicitation template includes 2003 Standard Instructions - Goods or Services, incorporated by reference. The Contract template includes 2010 General Conditions - Goods or Services (Medium Complexity), incorporated by reference. Where the Bid Solicitation is not used, retain Part 4 only of the document and delete the title 'Part 4 - Resulting Contract Clauses' before use.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Notes to Templates:</strong></em><br/>
            The Contracting Authority must ensure there are no contradictions, inconsistencies and redundancies with the clauses contained in the templates, the Standard Instructions and the General Conditions. </p>
<p>The Bid Solicitation Templates and the Contract Templates include instructional information, as applicable. All this instructional information must be removed before issuing the documents.</p>
<p>In English, the words 'Contractor', 'Bidder', 'Work', 'Contract' and 'Contracting Authority' are capitalized when they are in the singular and preceded by 'the' because, with the exception of 'Bidder', they are defined in the Contract. <br/>
            In French, this rule for capitalization does not apply.</p>
<h4>Chapter 7 - Competitive Procurement</h4>
<p><strong>Section 7A: Preparing a Bid Solicitation</strong></p>
<p>7A.001 (2005/06/10) The cover pages of bid solicitations are based on standard forms. They are:<br/>

<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>-TPSGC 9168 Request for a Supply Arrangement<br/>
<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>-TPSGC 212 Revision to a Supply Arrangement<br/>
<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>-TPSGC 9169 Supply Arrangement (This is not a contract)</p>
<p>Every bid solicitation should include the standard instructions and conditions (Section 1 of the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual), which will provide bidders with relevant information.</p>
<h4>Terms and Conditions</h4>
<p>7A.002 (2005/06/10) Most procurements of goods or services are to be carried out using the general conditions and supplemental general conditions found in the SACC Manual. The conditions to be used depend on the nature of the procurement as listed below.</p>
