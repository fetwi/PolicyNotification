<p>1. The simplified <em>Customs Tariff</em> and the related <em>Customs Act</em> amendments are effective from January 1, 1998.</p>
<p>2. The Government has introduced a new tariff with a single, consolidated schedule to replace the seven previous schedules. The customs legislation has been restructured and updated, whereby regulatory changes have been made prior to the implementation of the new <em>Customs Tariff</em>. Under these changes, the Defence Supplies Remission Order (DSRO) has been revoked and converted to tariff item number 9982.00.00 from Chapter 99-58 of the Schedule to the <em>Customs Tariff</em>.</p>
<p>3. The regulations under the DSRO are being retained for excise tax purposes.</p>
<p>4. The amended <em>Customs Act</em> allows importers four years from the time of accounting to file adjustments that would result in the payment of additional duties and taxes, or to file corrections for a refund of duties and taxes already paid.</p>
<p>5. The appeals process will be reduced to one level by replacing the first level with a streamlined adjustment process. A standard 90-day time limit for filing an appeal will apply to all Revenue Canada Programs.</p>
<p>6. Further references, in the <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions</em> (SACC) Manual and the <em>Supply Manual </em>(SM), to Order-in-Council P.C. 1992-2415, will be replaced with the new tariff item number 9982.00.00 under Chapter 99-58, <em>Customs Tariff</em> Schedule 1, for goods subject to this code.</p>
<p>7. The SACC clause A9006D remains unchanged.</p>
<p>8. Related changes to the SM, attached as <strong>Annex A</strong>, will be included in amendment 98-2 which is scheduled for release on 15 June 1998.</p>
<p>9. Related changes to the SACC Manual, attached as <strong>Annex B</strong>, will be included in amendment 98-2 which is scheduled for release on 15 June 1998.</p>

<p><strong>Remarks:</strong> When the contractor is the importer, use the following clause in bid solicitations and contracts for defence supplies valued at C$250,000 or more where the item or components of the item are imported under the <em>Customs Tariff</em> respecting the remission of customs duties.
