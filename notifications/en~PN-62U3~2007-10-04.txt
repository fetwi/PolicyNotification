<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification (PN) 62U3 is to update the Department<br/>
					of National Defence (DND) shipping instructions detailed in <em>Standard<br/>
					Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual</em> clause D0035C.<br/>
					The Inbound Logistics United Kingdom's office has moved to another<br/>
					location, and as a result, their telephone and facsimile numbers have<br/>
					changed.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, contracting officers must use the revised clause<br/>
					D0035C in all new contracts when appropriate. Contracting officers should<br/>
					also review existing contracts that contain clause D0035C and that have<br/>
					pending deliveries, and take appropriate measures to ensure that contractors<br/>
					have the correct shipping instructions and contact information.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="#PN-62U3annexa">Annex A</a> of this document for changes to the clause D0035C. The changes<br/>
					will be incorporated into Version 07-2 of the SACC Manual, to be released<br/>
					in November 2007.</p>
<h3>Contact </h3>
<p>Any inquiries are to be addressed to Veronica Nazareth, Acquisition<br/>
					Policy and Process Directorate, by phone at 819-956-5024, or by e-mail<br/>
