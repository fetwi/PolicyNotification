<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p><abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>-139R1 replaces and supersedes <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>-139.</p>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification (PN)-139R1 is to inform <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Acquisitions Program (AP) contracting officers of the new clauses and templates drafted to support implementation of the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32610" rel="external">Directive on Government Contracts, Including Real Property Leases, in the Nunavut Settlement Area</a> (the Directive).</p>
<h3>Effective date</h3>
<p>This policy notification is effective immediately and supports the Directive that has been in effect since December 20, 2019. The Supply Manual (SM), Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions (SACC) clauses, and Standard Procurement Templates have been updated.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>On December 20, 2019, the Treasury Board <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32610" rel="external">Directive on Government Contracts, Including Real Property Leases, in the Nunavut Settlement Area</a> came into effect. The Directive was developed in close consultation with the <a href="https://www.tunngavik.com/about/" rel="external">Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI)</a>, the Designated Inuit Organization (DIO) for the Agreement between the Inuit of the Nunavut Settlement Area and Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada (Nunavut Agreement). The Directive supports the <a href="https://nlca.tunngavik.com/?page_id=2366" rel="external">Government of Canada’s obligations under Article 24 (Government Contracts)</a> of the Nunavut Agreement to provide reasonable support and assistance to Inuit firms to enable them to compete for government contracts, for the supply of goods, services, construction services and real property leases. </p>
<h3>Application of the Directive </h3>
<p>The requirements of the Directive apply to any government contract (as defined in Article 24.1.1 of the Nunavut Agreement), including real property leases, where the deliverable(s), or a portion of the deliverable(s) include final delivery or performance in or into the Nunavut Settlement Area (NSA).</p>
<p>The Directive applies to departments and agencies listed in Schedules I, I.1 and II of the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/FullText.html" rel="external"><cite>Financial Administration Act</cite></a> (FAA), with the exception of the Canada Revenue Agency and to Commissions established pursuant to the <cite>Inquiries Act</cite> that are designated as departments for the purposes of the <cite>Financial Administration Act</cite>.</p>
<p>In the event of a conflict between the Directive and a requirement of any other Treasury Board or departmental policy, the Directive will take precedence.</p>
<h3>Guide on Government Contracts in the Nunavut Settlement Area (the Guide)</h3>
<p>As required in the Directive, a government-wide guide titled “Guide on Government Contracts in the Nunavut Settlement Area” has been developed to assist Contracting Authorities (CA) and Technical Authorities (TA) in fulfilling the obligations of the Directive. The Guide assumes a general understanding of Canada’s procurement process, and focuses advice on areas where the Directive represents a significant departure from the standard procurement approach. The Guide can be accessed here: <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/for-government/buying-for-the-government-of-canada/plan-the-procurement-strategy#nunavut-directive">Guide on Government Contracts in the Nunavut Settlement Area</a>.</p>
<h3>Expected results</h3>
<p>The Directive and its implementation measures (including the Guide) reflect the expected results of Article 24 of the Nunavut Agreement which are, to the extent possible, as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>increased participation by Inuit firms in business opportunities in the <abbr title="Nunavut Settlement Area">NSA</abbr> economy;</li>
<li>improved capacity of Inuit firms to compete for government contracts and real property leases in the <abbr title="Nunavut Settlement Area">NSA</abbr>; and</li>
<li>employment of Inuit at a representative level in the <abbr title="Nunavut Settlement Area">NSA</abbr> workforce. </li>
</ul>
<p>It is also expected that the procurement obligations in the Nunavut Agreement will be more consistently applied across the federal government by following the provisions of the Guide.
</p>
<h3>Key policy measures of the Directive</h3>
<ol type="i">
<li><a href="https://inuitfirm.tunngavik.com/" rel="external"><strong>Inuit Firm Registry (IFR)</strong></a><br/>
<p>As per the Nunavut Agreement, <abbr title="Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated">NTI</abbr> is responsible for preparing and maintaining a registry of Inuit firms, and identifying the commodities and services those firms provide. This list is referred to as the Inuit Firm Registry (IFR). <abbr title="Contracting Authorities">CAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Technical Authorities">TA</abbr>s must consult the <abbr title="Inuit Firm Registry">IFR</abbr> before soliciting or inviting bids for a government contract in the <abbr title="Nunavut Settlement Area">NSA</abbr>.
            <abbr title="Contracting Authorities">CAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Technical Authorities">TA</abbr>s are directed to rely on the <abbr title="Inuit Firm Registry">IFR</abbr> to confirm whether a bidder and/or their subcontractor(s) meets the definition of Inuit firm for the purposes of limited bidding, or for the award of points related to Inuit and Nunavut Benefits Criteria.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Limiting bids to Inuit firms</strong>
<p>The Directive establishes a new mandatory policy measure to limit bidding on government contracts among Inuit firms on the <abbr title="Inuit Firm Registry">IFR</abbr> when there are two or more firms listed for that commodity or service.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Inuit Benefits Criteria/Nunavut Benefits Criteria (IBC/NBC)</strong><br/>
<p>The Directive requires that bid evaluation criteria (against which all bids are to be evaluated) related to Inuit and Nunavut Benefits be included in all competitive processes, depending on the estimated contract value. For procurements where the total estimated contract value is over $100,000 the Inuit and Nunavut Benefits criteria must be included in the solicitation, and for contracts under $100,000 best "efforts" must be used to include them when practicable, and in keeping with sound procurement management principles. </p>
<p>The Inuit and Nunavut Benefits criteria are used alongside price and technical criteria in evaluating bids and selecting a successful bidder.</p>
<p><strong>Inuit Benefits Criteria are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inuit employment:</strong> to evaluate the employment of Inuit labour</li>
<li><strong>Inuit training and skills development:</strong> to evaluate the undertaking of commitments, under the contract, with respect to training or skills development for Inuit</li>
<li><strong>Inuit ownership</strong> (prime contractor and subcontractors): to evaluate whether the bidder is an Inuit firm on the <abbr title="Inuit Firm Registry">IFR</abbr>, and whether Inuit firms on the <abbr title="Inuit Firm Registry">IFR</abbr> will be engaged as subcontractor(s) in carrying out the government contract</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nunavut Benefits Criteria are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location in the <abbr title="Nunavut Settlement Area">NSA</abbr>:</strong> to evaluate whether the bidder or the subcontractor(s) have head offices, administrative offices or other facilities in the Nunavut Settlement Area</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unbundling</strong><br/>
<p>Unbundling is a process of analyzing the procurement to determine if there is an opportunity to invite bids by commodity groupings, or by breaking off a part of the requirement as a smaller contract package. <abbr title="Contracting Authorities">CAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Technical Authorities">TA</abbr>s must determine whether the procurement’s operational requirements permit, where practicable and consistent with sound procurement management, the unbundling of a larger contract to permit for smaller and more specialized Inuit firms to submit bids.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory documenting and reporting requirements</strong><br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documenting:</strong> <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32610#appC" rel="external">Appendix C</a> of the Directive requires that <abbr title="Contracting Authorities">CAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Technical Authorities">TA</abbr>s document and justify certain decisions related to the procurement.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting:</strong> <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32610#appD" rel="external">Appendix D</a> of the Directive requires that <abbr title="Contracting Authorities">CAs</abbr> and <abbr title="Technical Authorities">TA</abbr>s complete and submit reports of government contracts valued at over $10,000 in the <abbr title="Nunavut Settlement Area">NSA</abbr>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Overview of changes</h3>
<p>In support of <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>-139R1, additions to the <abbr title="Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual, modifications to the Standard Procurement Templates, and the Supply Manual have been made. These additions are meant to provide additional support for Contracting Authorities seeking to integrate the obligations of the Nunavut Directive within their procurements.</p>
<p>Strategic Policy Sector’s Indigenous Procurement Policy Division (IPPD) must be advised of procurements that will be taking place in the <abbr title="Nunavut Settlement Area">NSA</abbr> and <abbr title="Contracting Authorities">CAs</abbr> may be required to provide file specific information to <abbr title="Indigenous Procurement Policy Division">IPPD</abbr> at any stage of their procurement regarding the implementation of the Directive.</p>
<p>There are supplementary templates (Inuit Benefits Plan (IBP), <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr> Evaluation, and <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr> Progress Report) referenced in the new <abbr title="Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual clauses and Standard Procurement Templates that must be applied to procurements subject to the Directive. For each new procurement, the most up-to-date supplementary templates must be obtained from <abbr title="Indigenous Procurement Policy Division">IPPD</abbr>.</p>
<p>Procurements that are subject to the Directive and that will evaluate <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr>s must also include an <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr> Holdback clause to ensure that the <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr> is enforced. For each new procurement, the most up-to-date <abbr title="Inuit Benefits Plan">IBP</abbr> Holdback clause and guidance on its utilization must be obtained from <abbr title="Indigenous Procurement Policy Division">IPPD</abbr>. In the event that a <abbr title="Contracting Authority">CA</abbr> would like to implement a holdback clause to enforce the delivery of Indigenous participation in a procurement not subject to the Nunavut Directive, they must seek legal advice prior to doing so.</p>
