<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>The purpose of this Policy Notification (PN) is to introduce and implement Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement documents for use by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) contracting officers to put in place standing offers for goods or services (excluding construction and architectural and engineering).  These documents include a Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) template, new standard instructions and general conditions.</p>
<h5>Policy</h5>
<p>Effective August 15, 2006, PWGSC contracting officers must use the Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement documents for the issuance of Standing Offers for goods or services.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a "common look and feel" for PWGSC's procurement documents, contracting officers must not modify or change the order and content of this standard template except where indicated.</p>
<p>The new RFSO template and the new standard instructions and general conditions for standing offers are identified in the table below.</p>

<h5>Implementation</h5>
<p>* Standard Instructions and Conditions - Standing Offers 9403-6 will be deleted in the <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions</em> (SACC) Manual. Parts A and B of 9403-6 are replaced by 2006 and 2005 respectively. Part C of 9403-6 is contained in general conditions 2029 and 2010 and the modified general conditions 9601, 9676 and 9624. These documents are included in Annex A to the PN.</p>
<p> These Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement documents will be available in the next release of the SACC Manual on 15 August 2006 and on the Plain Language Standard Procurement Website.</p>
<h5>Next Steps </h5>
<p>The Plain Language Working Group will review and develop standard procurement documents (e.g. plain language templates, standard instructions and general conditions for bid solicitations and contracts) for higher complexity requirements and supply arrangements.</p>
<p>Procurement Process Tools Division is responsible for the ongoing maintenance of the Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement documents.  All modifications to these documents will be published in future updates to the Plain Language Standard Procurement Website and to the SACC Manual.</p>

<h5>2T-PROC2 (2006-08-15) Procedures for Using the Request for Standing Offers Template - Goods or Services</h5>
<p>The Request for Standing Offers (RFSO), the standard instructions and the general conditions for standing offers were established in consultation with Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) Legal Services.</p>
<p>Contracting officers must use the standard documents in accordance with the following procedures:</p>
<h5>1. 2T-RFSO1, Request for Standing Offers Template - Goods or Services</h5>
<p>1.1	Inclusions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>must be used for standard, well defined requirements for goods, services or both</li>
<li>must be used for all goods, services or both requirements for standing offers where one of the general conditions 2029, 2010, 9601, 9676 and 9624 applies;</li>
</ol>
<p>1.2 Exclusions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Supply arrangements</li>
<li>Construction and Architectural and Engineering (A &amp; E) contracting requirements</li>
<li>Canadian Commercial Corporation requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>1.3 The requirements for the Standing Offer (SO) method of supply are defined in the Supply Manual, chapter 5 (procedures 5.153 to 5.188).  As per SM procedure 5.154, the SO method of supply is usually considered when:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>one or more clients repetitively order(s) the same range of goods, services, or both and the actual demand (e.g. quantity, delivery date, delivery point) is not known in advance;</li>
<li>some of the following conditions are present:<br/>
<ol type="i">
<li>the goods, services, or both are well defined;</li>
<li>prearranged prices or a prearranged pricing basis can be established at the outset and there is no need nor any intention to negotiate them at the time of the call-up;</li>
<li>the goods, services, or both are readily available and are to be ordered (called-up) as-and-when the requirement arises;</li>
<li>at the time of the call-up, there is no need nor any intention to further negotiate the terms and conditions;</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>1.4 Template must be used with:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>2006, Standard Instructions - Request for Standing Offers - Goods or Services, in lieu of Part A of 9403-6, Standard Instructions and Conditions - Standing Offers.</li>
<li>2005, General Conditions - Standing Offers - Goods or Services, is to be used in lieu of Part B of 9403-6.</li>
<li>one of the following as appropriate:<br/>
<ol type="i">
<li>2029, General Conditions - Goods or Services (Low Dollar Value) <span>or</span></li>
<li>2010, General Conditions - Goods or Services (Medium Complexity) <span>or</span></li>
<li>9601, General Conditions - Long Form <span>or</span></li>
<li>9676, General Conditions - Services <span>or</span></li>
<li>9624, General Conditions - Research &amp; Development.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="alignCenter">RFSO Std Instructions 2006<br/>

					SO General Conditions 2005<br/>

					Resulting Contract GC - {2029 <span>OR</span> 2010 <span>OR</span> 9601 <span>OR</span> 9676 <span>OR</span> 9624}</p>
<p>1.5 The RFSO Template is divided into five (parts) plus annexes:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Part I - General Information;</li>
<li>Part 2 - Offeror Instructions;</li>
<li>Part 3 - Offer Preparation Instructions;</li>
<li>Part 4 - Evaluation Procedures, Basis of Selection and Certifications;</li>
<li>Part 5:<br/>
<ol type="A">
<li>Standing Offer; and</li>
<li>Resulting Contract Clauses; and the Annexes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>1.6 For the purposes of the template, the main headings are referred to as "articles".  SACC Manual clauses or other approved clauses added to the template under an article will be addressed as "clauses".</p>
<p>1.7  SACC Manual clauses, other approved clauses and/or annexes for specific commodity needs may be added to the template as necessary for the requirement provided they are not covered within the standard instructions and general conditions applicable to the RFSO.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>SACC Manual clauses in section "5-M" ending with "T" may be added to Part 1 - General Information, Part 2 - Offeror Instructions, Part 3 - Offer Preparation Instructions, Part 4 - Evaluation Procedures, Basis of Selection and Certifications of the RFSO only.  If there is no existing section "5-M" clause to address a specific requirement pertaining to Offeror Instruction,  clauses from other sections with SACC number ending with "T" may be added subject to modification.</li>
<li>SACC Manual clauses in section "5-M" ending with "C" may be added to Part 5 A. Standing Offer only. If there is no existing section "M" clause to address a specific requirement pertaining to Part A. Standing Offer, clauses from other sections with SACC numbering ending with "C" or "D" may be added subject to modification.</li>
<li>SACC Manual clauses ending with "C" or "D" with the exception of clauses in section "5-M" may be added to Part 5 B. Resulting Contract Clause.</li>
</ol>
<p>1.8	TIPS:</p>
<p>Contracting officers must ensure that:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>they know the standard instructions and general conditions so there are no contradictions, inconsistencies and redundancies with the clauses contained in the template, the standard instructions and the general conditions;</li>
<li>SACC  Manual clauses with no blanks to be filled in are incorporated by reference under the article "SACC Manual Clauses" in the applicable portions of the template. While incorporating SACC clauses by reference may be contrary to current procedures identified under the Remarks section of the SACC Manual, this approach is recommended by Legal and must be followed when using the Plain Language Templates;</li>
<li>SACC Manual clauses with blanks or other clauses are added in full text, under the appropriate article or clause;</li>
<li>other pertinent clauses, not belonging under existing articles may be added as "stand alone clauses" at the end of the related "Part" of the template to address commodity requirements, as required;</li>
<li>the Table of Contents is updated to reflect "articles" added as "stand alone" or deleted articles;</li>
<li>all instructional information contained in the template is removed before issuing the RFSO;</li>
<li>they take full advantage of the Remarks contained in the templates;</li>
<li>they always have a hard copy of the "master" template handy as a reference tool (e.g. Remarks, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>1.9	WAY FORWARD</p>
<p>An introductory paragraph under the RFSO Part I, Article 1 "Introduction" must be included for all Way Forward requirements.</p>

<h5>General Information</h5>
<p>One method of supply used by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) to satisfy the requirements of departments and agencies is to arrange with suppliers to submit a standing offer to provide goods, services or both during a specified period. Specific departments and agencies are then authorized by PWGSC to make call-ups against the standing offer detailing the exact quantities of goods or level of services they wish to order at a particular time, during the effective period of the standing offer in accordance with the predetermined conditions.</p>
<p>The process normally starts with a Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) that suppliers may obtain through the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS). A RFSO is an invitation to suppliers to provide PWGSC with a standing offer. The quantity of goods, level of services and estimated expenditure specified in the RFSO are only an approximation of requirements given in good faith. A RFSO does not commit PWGSC to authorize the utilization of a standing offer or to procure or contract for any goods, services or both. A standing offer is not a contract. The issuance by PWGSC of a Standing Offer and Call-up Authority (SOCA) to successful suppliers and to departments and agencies authorized to make call-ups does not constitute an agreement by Canada to order any or all of the goods, services or both offered. Departments and agencies may make one or several call-ups against a standing offer. </p>
<h5>01. Procurement Business Number</h5>
<p>Canadian suppliers are required to have a Procurement Business Number<br/>
					(PBN) before issuance of a standing offer. Suppliers<br/>
					may register for a PBN in the Supplier Registration<br/>
					Information service on line at the <a href="https://canadabuys.canada.ca/">Buy and Sell Website</a>. For non-Internet registration, suppliers<br/>
					may contact the Buy and Sell InfoLine at<br/>
					1-800-811-1148 to obtain the telephone number of the<br/>
	nearest Supplier Registration Agent.</p>
<h5>02. Standard Instructions, Clauses and Conditions</h5>
<p>Pursuant to the <em>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c.16, the instructions, clauses and conditions identified in the RFSO, standing offer and resulting contract(s) by title, number and date are incorporated by reference into and form part of the RFSO, standing offer and resulting contract(s) as though expressly set out in the RFSO, the standing offer and the resulting contract(s). </p>
<h5>03. Submission of Offers</h5>
<ol>
<li>Canada requires that each offer be signed by the Offeror or by an authorized representative of the Offeror. If an offer is being submitted by a joint venture, the offer must clearly state that it is submitted as a joint venture and must be signed by all members of the joint venture or a statement must be provided to the effect that the signatory represents all members of the joint venture.</li>
<li>It is the Offeror's responsibility to:<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>obtain clarification of the requirements contained in the RFSO, if necessary, before submitting an offer;</li>
<li>prepare its offer in accordance with the instructions contained in the RFSO;</li>
<li>submit by closing time and date a signed and complete offer;</li>
<li>send its offer only to Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) Bid Receiving Unit specified on page 1 of the RFSO or to the address specified in the RFSO;</li>
<li>ensure that the Offeror's name, return address, RFSO number, and RFSO closing date and time are clearly visible on the envelope or the parcel(s) containing the offer; and,</li>
<li>provide a comprehensible and sufficiently detailed offer, including all requested pricing details, that will permit a complete evaluation in accordance with the criteria set out in the RFSO.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If Canada has provided offerors with multiple formats of a document (for example, a document may be downloaded through the GETS but may also be made available on CD-ROM through GETS), the format downloaded through the GETS will take precedence. If Canada issues an amendment to the RFSO revising any documents provided to offerors in multiple formats, Canada will not necessarily update all formats to reflect these revisions.  It is the Offeror's responsibility to ensure that revisions made through any RFSO amendment issued through the GETS are taken into account in the alternate formats it uses of RFSO documents.</li>
<li>Offers will remain open for acceptance for a period of not less than sixty (60) days from the closing date of the RFSO, unless otherwise indicated in the RFSO. Canada reserves the right to seek an extension of the offer validity period from all responsive offerors in writing, within a minimum of three (3) days before the end of the offer validity period. If the extension is accepted by all responsive offerors, Canada will continue with the evaluation of the offers. If the extension is not accepted by all responsive offerors, Canada will, at its sole discretion, either continue with the evaluation of the offers of those who have accepted the extension or cancel the RFSO.</li>
<li>Offers and supporting information may be submitted in either English or French.</li>
<li>For Canadian-based offerors, Canadian customs duties and excise taxes must be included and, Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) must be excluded. For foreign-based offerors, Canadian customs duties, excise taxes and GST or HST, must be excluded. Canadian customs duties and excise taxes payable by Canada will be added, for evaluation purposes only, to the prices submitted by foreign-based offerors.
<p>						Although Canada reserves the right to issue standing offer(s) either on an FOB plant or FOB destination basis or other Incoterms as indicated in the RFSO, offerors are requested to provide prices as indicated in the RFSO.</p></li>
<li>Offers received on or before the stipulated RFSO closing date and time will become the property of Canada and will not be returned. All offers will be treated as confidential, subject to the provisions of the <em>Access<br/>
						to Information Act</em> R.S.C. 1985, c.A-1 and the <em>Privacy<br/>
						Act </em>R.S.C. 1985, c.P-21.</li>
<li>Except as specifically provided otherwise in the RFSO, Canada will evaluate an offeror's offer only on the documentation provided as part of its offer. Canada will not consider in the evaluation of the offer references to additional information not submitted with the offer, such as website addresses where additional information can be found or technical manuals or brochures not submitted with the offer.</li>
</ol>
<h5>04. Late Offers</h5>
<p>PWGSC will return offers delivered after the stipulated RFSO closing date and time, unless they qualify as a delayed offer as described below.</p>
<h5>05. Delayed Offers</h5>
<ol>
<li>An offer delivered to the specified Bid Receiving Unit after the closing date and time but before the standing offer issuance date may be considered, provided the delay can be proven to have been due solely to a delay in delivery that can be attributed to the Canada Post Corporation (CPC) (or national equivalent of a foreign country). Purolator Inc. is not considered to be part of CPC for the purposes of delayed offers. The only pieces of evidence relating to a delay in the CPC system that are acceptable to PWGSC are:<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>CPC cancellation date stamp; or</li>
<li>CPC Priority Courier Bill of Lading; or</li>
<li>CPC Xpresspost Label</li>
</ol>
<p>						that clearly indicates that the offer was mailed before the RFSO closing date </p></li>
<li>For offers transmitted by facsimile, only the date, time and place of receipt recorded by PWGSC will be accepted as evidence of a delayed offer.</li>
<li>Misrouting, traffic volume, weather disturbances, labour disputes or any other causes for the late delivery of offers are not acceptable reasons for the offer to be accepted by PWGSC.</li>
<li>Postage meter imprints, whether imprinted by the Offeror, the CPC or the postal authority outside Canada, are not acceptable as proof of timely mailing.</li>
</ol>
<h5>06. Transmission by Facsimile</h5>
<ol>
<li>Unless otherwise instructed in the RFSO, offers may be submitted by facsimile. The only acceptable facsimile number for responses to RFSOs issued by PWGSC headquarters is 819-997-9776. The facsimile number for responses to RFSOs issued by PWGSC regional offices is identified in the RFSO.</li>
<li>If the Offeror submits an offer by facsimile, Canada will not be responsible for any failure attributable to the transmission or receipt of the faxed offer including, but not limited to, the following:<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>receipt of garbled or incomplete offer;</li>
<li>availability or condition of the receiving facsimile equipment;</li>
<li>incompatibility between the sending and receiving equipment;</li>
<li>delay in transmission or receipt of the offer;</li>
<li>failure of the Offeror to properly identify the offer;</li>
<li>illegibility of the offer; or</li>
<li>security of offer data.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Offers submitted by facsimile will constitute the formal offer of the Offeror and must be submitted in accordance with Section 03, Submission of Offers.  For responses transmitted by facsimile, written confirmation is required within two (2) working days after RFSO closing, unless otherwise specified in the RFSO. All documents confirming offers should bear the word "CONFIRMATION".</li>
</ol>
<h5>07. Customs Clearance</h5>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Offeror to allow sufficient time to obtain customs clearance, where required, before the RFSO closing date and time. Delays related to the obtaining of customs clearance cannot be construed as "undue delay in the mail" and will not be accepted as a delayed offer under Section 05, Delayed Offers.</p>
<h5>08. Legal Capacity</h5>
<p>The Offeror must have the legal capacity to contract. If the Offeror is a sole proprietorship, a partnership or a corporate body, the Offeror must provide, if requested by the Standing Offer Authority, a statement and any requested supporting documentation indicating the laws under which it is registered or incorporated together with the registered or corporate name and place of business. This also applies to offerors submitting an offer as a joint venture.</p>
<h5>09. Rights of Canada</h5>
<p>Canada reserves the right to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>reject any or all offers received in response to the RFSO;</li>
<li>enter into negotiations with offerors on any or all aspects of their offers;</li>
<li>authorize for utilization any offer in whole or in part without negotiations;</li>
<li>cancel the RFSO at any time;</li>
<li>reissue the RFSO;</li>
<li>if no compliant offers are received and the requirement is not substantially modified, re-tender the requirement by inviting only the offerors who submitted an offer to re-submit offers within a period designated by Canada; and,</li>
<li>negotiate with the sole compliant Offeror to ensure best value to Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h5>10.Vendor Performance</h5>
<ol>
<li>Canada may reject an offer where any of the following circumstances is present:<br/>
<ol type="a">
<li>the Offeror, or any employee or subcontractor included as part of the offer, has been convicted under Section 121 (Frauds on the government &amp; Contractor subscribing to election fund), Section 124 (Selling or purchasing office), or Section 418 (Selling defective stores to Her Majesty) of the Criminal Code; or,</li>
<li>the Offeror is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Policy, which renders the Offeror ineligible to bid on the requirement;</li>
<li>an employee or subcontractor included as part of the offer, is subject to a Vendor Performance Corrective Measure, under the Vendor Performance Policy, which would render that employee or subcontractor ineligible to bid on the requirement, or the portion of the requirement the employee or subcontractor is to perform;</li>
<li>with respect to current or prior transactions with the Government of Canada<br/>
<ol type="i">
<li>the Offeror is bankrupt or where, for whatever reason, its activities are rendered inoperable for an extended period;</li>
<li>evidence, satisfactory to Canada, of fraud, bribery, fraudulent misrepresentation or failure to comply with any law protecting individuals against any manner of discrimination, has been received with respect to the Offeror, any of its employees or any subcontractor included as part of its offer;</li>
<li>Canada has exercised its contractual remedies of suspension or termination for default with respect to a contract with the Offeror, any of its employees or any subcontractor included as part of its offer;</li>
<li>Canada determines that the Offeror's performance on other contracts, including the efficiency and workmanship as well as the extent to which the Offeror executed the requirement in accordance with contractual terms and conditions, is sufficiently poor to jeopardize the successful completion of the requirement being bid on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Where Canada intends to reject an offer pursuant to a provision of paragraph 1, other than 1(b), the Standing Offer Authority will so inform the Offeror and provide the Offeror ten (10) days within which to make representations, before making a final decision on the offer rejection.</li>
</ol>
<h5>11. Communications - Solicitation Period</h5>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the competitive RFSO process, enquiries and other communications regarding the RFSO, must be directed only to the Standing Offer Authority identified in the RFSO. Failure to comply can (for that reason alone) result in the disqualification of the offer.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency and quality of information provided to offerors, significant enquiries received and the replies to such enquiries will be provided simultaneously to offerors to which the RFSO has been sent, without revealing the sources of the enquiries.</p>
<h5>12. Price Support</h5>
<p>In the event that the Offeror's offer is the sole responsive offer received, the Offeror must provide, on Canada's request, one or more of the following price support if applicable:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>a current published price list indicating the percentage discount available to PWGSC</li>
<li>copies of paid invoices for like services performed for other customers or for like items (same quantity and quality) sold to other customers;</li>
<li>a price breakdown showing the cost of direct labour, direct materials, purchased items, engineering and plant overheads, general and administrative overhead, transportation, etc., profit;</li>
<li>price or rate certifications;</li>
<li>any other supporting documentation as requested by Canada.</li>
</ol>
<h5>13.Offer Costs</h5>
<p>No payment will be made for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of an offer in response to the RFSO. Costs associated with preparing and submitting an offer as well as any costs incurred by the Offeror associated with the evaluation of the offer, are the sole responsibility of the Offeror.</p>
<h5>14. Conduct of Evaluation</h5>
<p>In conducting its evaluation of the offers, Canada may, but will have no obligation to, do the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>seek clarification or verification from offerors regarding any or all information provided by them with respect to the RFSO;</li>
<li>contact any or all references supplied by offerors to verify and validate any information submitted by them;</li>
<li>request, before issuance of any standing offer, specific information with respect to offerors' legal status;</li>
<li>conduct a survey of offerors' facilities and/or examine their technical, managerial, and financial capabilities to determine if they are adequate to meet the requirements of the RFSO;</li>
<li>correct any error in the extended pricing of offers by using unit pricing and any error in quantities in offers to reflect the quantities stated in the RFSO;</li>
<li>verify any information provided by offerors through independent research, use of any government resources or by contacting third parties;</li>
<li>interview, at the sole costs of offerors, any offeror and/or any or all of the resources proposed by offerors to fulfill the requirement of the RFSO.</li>
</ol>
<p>Offerors will have the number of days specified in the request by the Standing Offer Authority to comply with any request related to any of the above items.  Failure to comply with the request may result in the offer being declared non-responsive.</p>
<h5>15. Further Information</h5>
<ol>
<li>For further information, offerors may contact the Standing Offer Authority identified in the RFSO</li>
<li>For RFSOs issued out of PWGSC headquarters, enquiries concerning receipt of offers may be addressed to the Bid Receiving Unit, Procurement Operational Support Division, telephone 819-956-3370. For RFSOs issued out of PWGSC regional offices, enquiries concerning receipt of offers may be addressed to the Standing Offer Authority identified in the RFSO</li>

<p>In the Standing Offer, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>
<p>"Call-up" means an order issued under the authority of the duly authorized Identified User against a particular standing offer. Communication of a call-up against a standing offer to the Offeror constitutes acceptance of its offer and results in the creation of a contract between Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and the Offeror for the goods, services or both described in the Call-up;</p>

Failure by the Offeror to comply will render the offer non-responsive.</p>

<h5>Chapter 6 - Developing the Procurement Strategy</h5>
<h6>Section 6E - Process</h6>
<h6>Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement Documents</h6>
<dl>
<dt>6E.643</dt>
<dd>(2006-08-15) Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) has implemented Departmental Plain Language Standard Procurement documents which includes new standard instructions, general conditions and templates for use by its contracting officers for the procurement of goods, services or both (excluding construction and architectural and engineering requirements).
<p>PWGSC contracting officers must use the Bid Solicitation and Resulting Contract templates for Low Dollar Value (LDV), Medium Complexity (MED) requirements and Requests for Standing Offers (RFSO) for goods, services or both for competitive and non-competitive requirements.  The templates 2T-LDV1, 2T-MED1 and 2T-RFSO1 are available in Section 2, Templates and Forms, of the Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual. </p>
<p>Contracting officers are invited to consult the procedures 2T-PROC1 and 2T-PROC2 for the use of the LDV, Medium Complexity and standing offer templates available in the SACC Manual and on the Plain Language Standard Procurement Website.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a "common look and feel" for PWGSC's procurement documents, contracting officer must not modify or change the order and content of these templates except where indicated.</p>
