<p>The year 2000 computer problem has the potential to cause severe disruption in the Government of Canada's computer systems. To reduce the probability of this disruption, procurement staff shall, effective immediately, follow the procedures detailed in Annex "A" attached, and use the applicable clause contained in Annex "B" attached, to obtain a warranty from vendors for procurements which include the provision of hardware, software, firmware or services for systems which will be required to perform date related processing prior to, during or after the year 2000.</p>
<p>Many systems could cease to work or could produce wrong answers when handling Year 2000 data. The problem is associated with a two digit representation of the year which would see no difference between Year 20"<em>00</em>" and Year 19"<em>00</em>". The Year 2000 impact will be felt in all systems where the date is used to either calculate or control systems.</p>
<p>Related changes to the <em>Supply Manual</em>, attached as <strong>Annex A</strong>, will be included in amendment 98-2 which is scheduled for release on June 15, 1998.</p>
<p>Related changes to the <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions Manual</em>, attached as<strong> Annex B</strong>, will be included in amendment 98-2, which is scheduled for release on June 15, 1998.</p>
<h3>ANNEX A</h3>
<h4>CHANGES TO THE SUPPLY MANUAL</h4>
<p>6.330 (23/06/94) It may be necessary to consider obtaining a broader warranty than that contemplated by the warranty provision appearing in the General Conditions to cover "symptomatic defects" or "epidemic failures."</p>
<p><em>These are cases where the same or similar defects have developed in several identical items of finished work, or components, and it is reasonable to assume that the same defects will be found in the total quantity of such items which have already been delivered, or remain to be delivered.</em></p>
<p>Where this type of warranty is requested by the client, or considered desirable by PWGSC, the contracting officer, in consultation with the client, must determine the extent and nature of the warranty required, and request Legal Services to prepare a suitable provision to cover the requirement. In the case of negotiated firm price contracts, the contracting officer must obtain the client's agreement to the estimated cost of this warranty.</p>
<h4>Year 2000 Warranty</h4>
<p>6.332 (__/__/98) For procurements of goods or services which must perform date related processing prior to, during  or after the Year 2000, Contracting Officers shall include one or more of the following appropriate SACC Manual clauses in bid solicitations, contracts and standing offers:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>SACC Manual clause K_____D for specific goods such as hardware, software or firmware;</li>
<li>SACC Manual clause K_____D for facility management or outsourcing services;</li>
<li>SACC Manual clause K_____D for integration services; and</li>
<li>SACC Manual clause K_____D for services.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of sole source or no substitute contracts or standing offers which include multiple products, where the vendor declares that the Year 2000 Warranty does not apply to certain products, then the contracting officer shall designate these products in the contract or standing offer.</p>
<p>In the case of a competitive process the Year 2000 Warranty clause(s) shall be included as a mandatory clause in the solicitation document.</p>
<p>To prevent confusion regarding contractors' obligations with respect to the approved Year 2000 Warranty clauses, the following practices must be followed where, in sole source or no substitute situations, the Contracting Officer negotiates any modifications to the Year 2000 Warranty clause(s): the modified clause shall be reviewed by Legal Services; accepted by the requisitioning department in writing as indicated below; and, the clause title shall not include the words "Year 2000 Warranty".</p>
<p>Where a client requests that the Year 2000 Warranty clause(s) not be incorporated into its procurement (for example, where the product, application or related services will not be used to perform date related processing), procurement staff are to comply with this request provided that the Director General of Informatics or departmental equivalent of the requisitioning department provided written instructions to this effect.</p>
