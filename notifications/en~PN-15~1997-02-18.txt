<p>Effective March 31, 1997, the Department of Public Works and Government Services will expand the types of information which can be released by contracting officers on a routine basis to include the unit prices for goods and services contained in standing offers.</p>
<p>This change will coincide with the publication of the next amendment to the <em>Supply Manual</em>.</p>
<p>As it is essential to inform bidders of our intention to disclose their unit prices, in the event of a resultant standing offer, clause M0090T must be incorporated in full text in all requests for standing offers (goods and services), effective March 31, 1997, and clause M0090C must be incorporated in all resultant Standing Offers. These clauses are attached (Annex A) and will be incorporated in the next amendment of the <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions Manual</em> scheduled for 2 June 1997.</p>
<p>A notice will be published shortly in the Open Bidding Service and in the <em>Government Business Opportunities</em> to advise bidders of this change in policy.</p>
<h3>Annex A</h3>
<p><strong>REMARKS</strong>: The following clause shall be used in all requests for standing offers for goods and services.</p>

<p><strong>REMARKS</strong>: The following shall be used in all standing offer documents where clause M0090T was used.</p>
