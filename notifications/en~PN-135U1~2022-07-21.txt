<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/applications/standing-offers-and-supply-arrangements-application-SOSA-App"><abbr title="Standing Offers and Supply Arrangements Application">SOSA App</abbr></a> is a secure, web based application that allows authorized federal, provincial and territorial users to use and view federal standing offers and supply arrangements. Increased security measures, including technological and process enhancements, have been added to the <abbr title="Standing Offers and Supply ArrangementsApplication">SOSA App</abbr> to reinforce document security.</p>
<p>Process enhancements to the <abbr title="Standing Offers and Supply ArrangementsApplication">SOSA App</abbr> include the requirement for contracting officers to ensure relevant documents have the appropriate security marking <strong>prior</strong> to uploading to the <abbr title="Standing Offers and Supply ArrangementsApplication">SOSA App</abbr>.</p>
<p>Contracting officers are reminded to safeguard documents containing sensitive information. Sensitive information, including third party information such as supplier price lists, must not be made available to the public and are designated as Protected B information. In addition, contracting officers are reminded that in instances where a document includes information that contains different levels of security, the highest category of security level found in the document must be applied to the entire document (High-Water Mark Approach). Consult the departmental guide on <a class="gov" href="https://masource-mysource.spac-pspc.gc.ca/eng/services/dgs-dob/pcms-spa/Pages/guideprot.aspx" rel="external">levels of security</a><span> (accessible only on the Government of Canada network)</span> for the security definition and categorization of sensitive information.</p>
<p>For additional examples of sensitive, third-party information, please refer to <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/page-3.html#h-515" rel="external">section 20 (1) of the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite></a>.</p>
