<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In response to input from departments, the Treasury Board Policy on Title to Intellectual Property arising from Procurement Contracts has been changed per Contracting Policy Notice (CPN) 2007-3, to allow departments to decide when there will be no Intellectual Property (IP) arising from a contract.  As a result, contracts may now have no IP terms.  Thus, the way client departments may deal with IP rights has changed.</p>
<p>Note: The client department must decide to what extent IP rights are to be retained by the Crown.</p>
<p>As a result of this policy change, there is a change in the IP categories for reporting for contracts over the threshold for competitive procurement, to reflect the following categories:</p>
<ul class="noBullet">
<li>A1: Crown owned - exception 6.1</li>
<li>A2: Crown owned - exception 6.2</li>
<li>A3: Crown owned - exception 6.3</li>
<li>A41: Crown owned - exception 6.4.1</li>
<li>A42: Crown owned - exception 6.4.2</li>
<li>A43: Crown owned - exception 6.4.3</li>
<li>A65: Crown owned - exception 6.5</li>
<li>A8: Crown owned - exception 8</li>
<li>B: Contractor Owned</li>
<li>C: No IP Terms in Contract</li>
<li>D: Organization Not Subject to IP Policy</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes will be incorporated in ABE.</p>
