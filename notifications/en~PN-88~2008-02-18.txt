<h3>Revisions to <acronym title="Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions">SACC</acronym> Manual Clauses</h3>
<h3><a id="PN-88b_G1001C" name="b_G1001C"></a>G1001C (2008-XX-XX) Insurance Requirements</h3>
<h4>Remarks:</h4>
<p>Risk arising from  work under the contract should be identified and assessed to determine whether  specific insurance requirements should be included in the contract. All contracts must include either this  clause or clause G1005C as may be applicable.</p>
<p>Use the following clause when insurance requirements are specifically described in the contract. Contracting officers must insert  the applicable insurance clauses contained in Section 5-G of the <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions</em> Manual in an annex to the contract.  For any other  insurance requirements, contact PWGSC Risk Management Advisory Services, at: <a href="mailto:ncr.rmias-scgra@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca" rel="external">ncr.rmias-scgra@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca</a>.</p>
<p>Use clause G1005C  when there is no specific insurance requirements to be included in the  contract.</p>
<h4>Text:</h4>
<p>The Contractor must  comply with the insurance requirements specified in Annex ____. The Contractor must maintain the required  insurance coverage for the duration of the Contract. Compliance with the insurance requirements does not release the  Contractor from or reduce its liability under the Contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor is  responsible for deciding if additional insurance coverage is necessary to  fulfill its obligation under the Contract and to ensure compliance with any  applicable law. Any additional  insurance coverage is at the Contractor's expense, and for its own benefit and  protection.</p>
<p>The  Contractor must forward to the Contracting Authority within ten (10) days after  the date of award of the Contract, a Certificate of Insurance evidencing the  insurance coverage and confirming that the insurance policy complying with the  requirements is in force. Coverage must  be placed with an Insurer licensed to carry out business in Canada. The Contractor must, if requested by the  Contracting Authority, forward to Canada a certified true copy of all  applicable insurance policies.</p>

Any insurance acquired or  maintained by the Contractor is at its own expense and for its own benefit and  protection.

<h4>Remarks: </h4>
<p>Use the following  clause when insurance requirements are specifically described in the contract  (except when using G2030C, G4001C or G5003C).</p>
<p>Whenever the  liabilities of Canada and the contractor  with respect to the contract are difficult to separate, contracting officers must replace paragraph 2.(a) by the following  option:</p>
<p>"Additional  Named Insured: Canada is added as an additional named insured, but only with  respect to liability arising out of the performance of the Contract."</p>
<p>Contracting officers  must choose options (l), (m), (n), (o), (p), (q) and/or (r) in paragraph 2 when  applicable to their specific contract.</p>
<p>Contracting officers  must consult PWGSC Risk Management Advisory Services, at: <a href="mailto:ncr.rmias-scgra@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca" rel="external">ncr.rmias-scgra@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca</a> if the suggested limit of $2,000,000 per accident or  occurrence is not considered adequate.</p>
<p>Construction  Contracts: For the majority of construction contracts, the Contractor's  Commercial General Liability Insurance policy is sufficient to protect the  interests of Canada. If a large,  multi-million dollar project involving many contractors and subcontractors is being  planned, then a separate Wrap-Up Liability Insurance policy should be arranged  specific to the project. Clauses  pertaining to wrap-up liability should be drafted at that time and will be  specific to the project.</p>

<h4>Remarks: </h4>
<p>Use the following  clause in contracts when Environmental Impairment Liability Insurance is  required. Environmental Impairment Liability insurance protects the contractor  against claims caused by gradual and sudden and accidental pollution damage to  the environment as well as Bodily Injury and Property Damage to third parties.</p>
<p>There  are four main types of Environmental Insurance coverage that may be carried by contractors depending  on their operations. Contracting  officers must insert one of the four types of insurance in paragraph 1 and 3  below: </p>
<ol class="noBullet">
<li>Type 1: "Pollution Legal Liability - Fixed Site  Coverage"</li>
<li>Type 2: "Contractors Pollution Liability"</li>
<li>Type 3: "Storage Tank Third Party Liability"</li>
<li>Type 4: "Contractors Professional Liability"</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever the liabilities of Canada and the contractor  with respect to the contract are difficult to separate, contracting officers  must replace paragraph 3. (a) by the following option:</p>
<p>"Additional Named Insured: Canada is added as an  additional named insured, but only with respect to liability arising out of the  performance of the Contract."</p>
<p>Contracting officers  must choose options (f) and/or (g) in paragraph 3 when applicable to their  contract.</p>
<p>Depending on the  services being provided by the contractor (ex: non-hazardous operations), it is  acceptable to simply use clause G2001C and include endorsement (r) Sudden and  Accidental Pollution. However, it is important  to note that Canada would have to discover the claim and report it within 120  hours for the coverage to respond.</p>

<h4>Remarks: </h4>
<p>Use the following  clause in contracts when vehicles are leased by Canada on a long-term basis.</p>
<h4>Text: </h4>
<ol>
<li>The  Contractor must not insure the risks to Canada arising from the use or  operation of vehicles leased by Canada on a long-term basis (over 30 days)  except where Provincial law makes it mandatory for the Contractor to insure any  leased vehicles. Where Provincial law  makes it mandatory to insure a leased vehicle, the Contractor must obtain  insurance coverage in respect of the vehicle supplied under the lease, and a  copy or evidence of such insurance is to be provided to Canada.</li>
<li>Canada may  decide not to purchase Collision, All Perils or Comprehensive Insurance. The option that must be chosen by Canada  when renting a vehicle must depend on the applicable Treasury Board Risk  Management Policy.</li>
<li>In the event  of an accident that is self-insured by Canada (as Lessee), Canada must obtain a  written estimate for the repairs and, in consultation with the Contractor (as  Lessor), must decide where the repairs are to be performed. If the Contractor decides to have the damage  repaired at another place and the cost of said repairs is higher then the  estimate obtained by Canada, Canada must only pay the lesser amount. Further, if the Contractor decides that the  vehicle is to be repaired at a place other then the place Canada chooses, the  Contractor must be responsible to pay transport costs of the vehicle to the  alternate location.</li>
<li>When a  rental vehicle is in a disabling accident, all rental charges must cease on  said vehicle.</li>
