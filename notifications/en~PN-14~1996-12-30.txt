<p>On December 19, 1996, Minister Diane Marleau, with Mr. André Lafond, President of the Shipbuilding Association of Canada, announced amendments to the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> policy on Ship Repair, Refit and Modernization which will promote greater competition for federal government ship repair, refit and modernization contracts.</p>
<p>The changes to the policy come into effect immediately. They were developed jointly by the federal government and Canada's shipbuilding industry in response to a proposal from the Shipbuilding Association of Canada (SAC) to Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC).</p>
<p>Previously, contracts above $5 million were either competed within Eastern Canada or Western Canada, depending on a vessel's area of origin. Under the policy, Eastern Canada includes Atlantic Canada, Quebec and Ontario. Western Canada includes all shipyards west of Ontario, and in the Yukon and Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>The revised policy eliminates the $5 million, $200,000 thresholds and $40,000 thresholds. All projects above $25,000 will now be competed across Eastern Canada or Western Canada, depending on the home port of the vessel.</p>
<p>In addition, vessel transfer costs -- fuel costs and, in some cases, the cost of transporting the delivery crew back to the home port -- will be included as an evaluation item when soliciting competitive bids for ship repair and refit work. These costs were not previously considered in the evaluation process because competition was confined to limited geographic areas.</p>
<p> The revised policy statement, which will be included in an upcoming amendment to the Supply Manual, is attached as <strong>Annex A</strong>.</p>
<p>Clause A0240T, to be used to establish vessel transfer costs is attached as <strong>Annex B</strong>. This clause will be included in an upcoming amendment to the SACC Manual.</p>

<h3>Annex A</h3>
<h4>Shipbuilding, Repair, Refit and Modernization</h4>
<p>5.104 (19/12/96) The <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> procedures for sourcing suppliers for work on Canadian government vessels derive from the government's <strong>Shipbuilding Procurement Policy</strong>. The objective of the policy is to encourage competition amongst Canadian shipyards. For all competitive shipbuilding, repair and modernization requirements as defined in the Shipbuilding Procurement Policy, subject to AIT, contracting officers must ensure that the details of the restrictions or practices are highlighted in the Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP)/solicitation documentation.</p>
<p>The <strong>NPP/solicitation documentation</strong> must contain the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>"The sourcing strategy relating to this procurement will be limited to suppliers in the (as applicable) Area of Origin in accordance with the Shipbuilding Procurement Policy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For procurement below $2 million subject to the Shipbuilding Procurement Policy, the Contract Award Notice (CAN) must also contain these details.</p>
<p>For procurement below $25,000, competition may be limited to the Province or Territory of Origin of the vessel.</p>
<p><em>The following procedures (5.105 to 5.110) apply only when the procurement is not subject to NAFTA or <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym>. NAFTA Chapter 10, Annex 1001.2b, paragraph 1.(a) and <acronym title="World Trade Organization - Agreement on Government Procurement">WTO-AGP</acronym> Annex 4 exempts "shipbuilding and repair".</em></p>
<p>5.105 (19/12/96) Definitions specific to the sourcing strategy of shipbuilding, ship repair,refit and modernization procurements are as follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Origin of the vessel - the operational home port of the vessel.</li>
<li>Area of Origin - the following Areas of Origin are recognized:<br/>
						Eastern Canada: Atlantic Canada (Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick), Quebec and Ontario.<br/>
						Western Canada: All shipyards west of Ontario and those in the Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories.</li>
<li>Province or Territory of Origin - the following Provinces or Territories of Origin are recognized:
<ul>
<li>Newfoundland</li>
<li>Nova Scotia</li>
<li>New Brunswick</li>
<li>Prince Edward Island</li>
<li>Quebec</li>
<li>Ontario</li>
<li>Manitoba</li>
<li>Saskatchewan</li>
<li>Alberta</li>
<li>British Columbia</li>
<li>Northwest Territories</li>
<li>Yukon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>5.106 (19/12/96) For new construction procurement over $25,000, competitions are to be conducted on a nation-wide basis when the following conditions are present:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The statement of requirement is sufficiently defined to permit assessment of competing bids by common standards.</li>
<li>Available shipyards, both in Eastern Canada and in Western Canada, have the technical capability to perform the work.</li>
<li>The vessel being procured is of a type that can be transferred and for which contingency costs are not unrealistic in relation to the total price.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Contingency costs are all related costs and the time involved in transferring a vessel from one shipbuilding area to the destination, and are taken into account when assessing the bids.</em></p>
<p>5.107 (19/12/96) For new construction procurement over $25,000, competitions are to be conducted within the Area of Origin when all conditions except 5.106(c) are present.</p>
<p>5.108 (19/12/96) For ship repair, refit and modernization requirements over $25,000, competitions are to be conducted within the Area of Origin of the vessel, provided adequate competition exists.</p>
<p>If adequate competition (two or more bidders) does not exist, the requirement may still remain in the Area of Origin provided a satisfactory contractual agreement can be reached with the one available capable shipyard. If a satisfactory contractual agreement cannot be reached, the competition is to be extended on a nation-wide basis.</p>
<p>Contingency costs for ship repair, refit and modernization requirements shall be only those costs which are directly related with the transfer of the vessel as defined below:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>For vessels that can be transported unmanned: Solicitation documents will specify the pick-up point and the delivery point. Bidders will be required to provide a cost to transport the vessel from the pick-up point and once the work is completed, a cost to transport the vessel to the delivery point. In cases where the Government will retain responsibility for delivery of the vessel to and from the shipyard/shiprepair facility and the vessel's homeport, using commercial towing, railway, highway transportation or other suitable means, solicitation documents will identify the cost of such transportation as the vessel transfer cost that will be added to the evaluation price. (See SACC clause A0240T)</li>
<li>For vessels that are manned for transport: Solicitation documents will identify the contingency cost that will be added to the evaluation price for the transfer of the vessel and its minimum delivery crew based on the geographical distance to and from the vessel's home port location and the shipyard/shiprepair facility where the work will be undertaken, and:<br/>
<ol type="i">
<li>The fuel cost based on the current market price for fuel and the vessel's fuel consumption at its most economical speed.</li>
<li>For unmanned refits, transportation costs for the minimum delivery crew base on the latest Treasury Board directives (see SACC clause A0240T).</li>
<li>For manned refits, contingency costs shall only include the fuel costs for transferring the vessel and shall not include any costs for transporting the crew (see SACC clause A0240T).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>5.109 <strong>Deleted</strong> (19/12/96)</p>
<p>5.110 (19/12/96) Procurements by direct allocation of contracts to specific shipyards are to be made only in cases where conditions permitting nation-wide, area, and Province or Territory competitions are not present. Such cases will arise when one or more of the following conditions exists:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Only one shipyard is capable of performing the work.</li>
<li>Performance of the work necessitates access to particular facilities that are adjacent to one shipyard.</li>
<li>The statement of requirement is not sufficiently defined to permit assessment of competitive bids by common standards.</li>
<li>Emergency requirements necessitate use of the nearest yard capable of performing the work.</li>
<li>Special operational considerations of the client limit movement of the vessel beyond a specified location.</li>
</ol>
