<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of Policy Notification 106 (PN-106) is to notify all Acquisitions Branch and Regional employees of changes to the <cite>Supply Manual</cite> and the Standard Procurement Templates concerning all references to security requirements in contracting.

<h2>Background</h2>
In response to the <a href="http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_200710_01_e_23825.html" rel="external">Chapter 1—Safeguarding Government Information and Assets in Contracting</a> of the <cite>2007 October Report of the Auditor General of Canada</cite>, a review of active contracts issued by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) was conducted. 

In 2009, a “fact-finding exercise” was conducted regarding a security file review of standing offers and supply arrangements and usage by client departments.  Although no actual breach in the security requirements were found, this review highlighted the need for clarifications of the roles and responsibilities of all involved in the procurement process. 

In response to this exercise, the Policy, Risk, Integrity and Strategic Management Sector (PRISMS) and the Industrial Security Program (ISP) worked together on reviewing the tools and information available to the procurement staff to help them ensure that security is properly addressed in all contracting documents.

Furthermore, a new <a class="gov-auth-link" href="http://publiservice.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ipm-dpi/politique-policy/p123-eng.html" rel="external">Departmental Policy on Compliance and Enforcement with Industrial Security Requirements (DP123)<img alt="The information is only accessible to federal government department and agency employees." class="gov-publiserve-icon" height="16" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA0AAAANCAQAAADY4iz3AAAAEUlEQVR42mNkwAkYR6UolgIACvgADsuK6xYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" width="20"/></a> has been approved and took effect on June 1, 2012. Information and processes on the application of this policy have been added to chapter 8 of the <cite>Supply Manual</cite>.

A full review of the <cite>Supply Manual</cite> was performed and many changes in the procurement process and the information needed were required. These changes are mostly minor but are important to consider. They are effective immediately.
