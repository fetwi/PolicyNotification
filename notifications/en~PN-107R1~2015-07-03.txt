<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual and <cite>Supply Manual</cite>  have undergone several updates following the initial release of PN-107R1 on July 3, 2015:</p>
<ul>
<li>September 17, 2015: The changes provided in Annex A were updated and incorporated in the <cite>Supply Manual</cite>. See the <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/Policy-and-Guidelines-Archive/Supply-Manual-Synopsis-Archive#15-3"><cite>Supply Manual</cite> Synopsis - Version 2015-3 for details</a>.</li>

The complete details of the revisions can be viewed in the <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/Standard-Acquisition-Clauses-and-Conditions-SACC-Manual/Standard-Acquisition-Clauses-and-Conditions-SACC-Synopsis/#2015-5">Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Synopsis - Version 2015-5</a>.</li>
<li>July 9, 2015: Changes were made to two real property contracting clauses. The complete details of the revisions can be viewed in the <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/Standard-Acquisition-Clauses-and-Conditions-SACC-Manual/Standard-Acquisition-Clauses-and-Conditions-SACC-Synopsis/#2015-4">Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Synopsis - Version 2015-4</a>. Revisions were also made to PN-107R1 to include editorial corrections, ensure consistency with the equivalent French document and align with the terminology used in the Government of Canada Integrity Regime. No substantive changes were made to the <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr> content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Through this Policy Notification 107R1, Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) is updating the Integrity Provisions surrounding its procurement and real property transactions to bring them in line with a new government-wide <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/ci-if-eng.html" rel="external">Integrity Regime</a>. The updated provisions introduce rules around suspension, modify the rules around ineligibility, institute due process and review in cases of mandatory ineligibility, and encourage self-declaration of unlawful business practices.</p>
<h2>Effective Date</h2>
<p>Effective immediately, contracting officers are instructed to amend their solicitation documents to reflect this revised approach.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Over the past several years, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> has implemented numerous measures to strengthen the integrity of the Department’s procurement and real property processes.</p>
<p>In July 2012, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> established a formal Integrity Framework, under its own authorities, designed to ensure that the government does not enter into contracts with suppliers that have criminal convictions in Canada. Subsequent enhancements to the Framework were made in November 2012 (<a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/policy-notifications/PN-107">ARCHIVED - Integrity Provisions – PN-107</a>) and March 2014 (<a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/policy-notifications/PN-107U1">ARCHIVED - Integrity Provisions - PN-107U1</a>), it was expanded to include foreign offences, affiliate convictions of a supplier and require that suppliers extend the same terms and conditions to subcontractors.</p>
<p>Continuing this effort, on July 3, 2015, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> implemented a new government-wide <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/ci-if-eng.html" rel="external">Integrity Regime</a> (introduced by the Government of Canada in Budget 2015) for its procurement and real property transactions to ensure that the Government of Canada does business with ethical suppliers. The new Integrity Regime is a policy-based approach that will be applied across federal departments and agencies through memoranda of understanding.</p>
<h2>Summary of Revisions to the Integrity Provisions</h2>
<p>The Integrity Provisions are being updated to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove mandatory ineligibility of suppliers for actions of an affiliate, unless the supplier has a degree of control over the convicted affiliate;</li>
<li>Ensure notification of supplier of mandatory ineligibility and allow ineligible suppliers to reduce their ineligibility period by five years through cooperation with law enforcement or third-party certification of improved business conduct and behaviour;</li>
<li>Allow companies to self-declare violations, so that they can begin the ineligibility period and remediation process immediately;</li>
<li>Introduce a new provision for when Public Interest Exception is invoked, it must be accompanied by an administrative agreement with the Minister of <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services">PWGS</abbr> to provide assurances that remedial action will be undertaken;</li>
<li>Allow <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to suspend bidders for up to 18 months in situations where a supplier has been charged with a listed offence or has admitted wrongdoing;</li>
<li>Ensure an automatic ten year ineligibility period for providing false or misleading information on the certification that neither the supplier nor its affiliates have been convicted in the last three years;</li>
<li>Render  a contractor ineligible for five years if they enter into a contract with an ineligible subcontractor; and</li>
<li>Allow <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> to publish a public list of all ineligible and suspended suppliers, including the period of ineligibility.</li>
</ul>
