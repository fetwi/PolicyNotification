<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification (PN)-148 is to inform Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) Acquisitions Program (AP) of the entry into force of the <a href="https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cuktca-acccru/agreement_trade_continuity-accord_continuite_commerciale.aspx?lang=eng" rel="external"><cite>Canada-United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement</cite></a> and its effect on government procurement. <strong>The government procurement obligations of the <cite>Canada-United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement</cite> are the same as those of the <cite>Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement</cite> (CETA).</strong></p>
<h4>Effective date</h4>
<p><abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>-148 is effective April 1, 2021 as the <cite>Canada-United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement</cite> will enter into force on that date.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>On January 30, 2020, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) formally left the European Union (EU). Subsequently, a transition period that saw the <abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> continue to be treated as an <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> Member State for the purposes of all of Canada’s international agreements with the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> (e.g. <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr>) ended on December 31, 2020. In order to ensure trade continuity, Canada and the <abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> have reached a new agreement called the <cite>Canada-United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement</cite> (Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr>).</p>
<p>On April 1, 2021, the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> will enter into force. The Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr>, which includes government procurement obligations, is an interim agreement that will be in place as Canada and the <abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> work towards negotiating a comprehensive free trade agreement. <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr> has remained and will continue to remain in force for government procurement obligations between Canada and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The entry into force of the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> will have minimal impact on the federal procurement process. This is because the <strong>Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> incorporates <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr> by reference</strong>. As a result, <strong>the government procurement obligations of the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr></strong>, including procedural obligations (such as rules on notices and bid periods) and market access obligations (e.g. thresholds, covered entities, covered commodities, etc.), <strong>are the same as those of <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr></strong>. The only substantive difference between the two agreements is that <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr> applies to government procurement obligations between Canada and the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>, whereas the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> applies to government procurement obligations between Canada and the <abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr>.</p>
<p>Therefore, as of April 1, 2021, to meet Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> obligations, <strong>contracting officers must determine whether the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> applies to their procurements</strong>. As mentioned, the market access obligations of the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> are the same as those of <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr>, including covered commodities and entities. The thresholds of the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> are also the same as <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr> thresholds (i.e. $238K for goods and services, $9.1M for construction – the official thresholds Contracting Policy Notice will be posted on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/policy-notice.html" rel="external">Treasury Board Secretariat’s Contracting Policy Notices</a> page). This means that if <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr> applies to a procurement, so does the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> (and vice versa).</p>
<p>As the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> has the same coverage as <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr>, contracting officers should be aware that the following procurements will once again be covered for <abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> suppliers upon the entry into force of the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Procurements of dredging services; and</li>
<li>Procurements for the Canadian Space Agency related to satellite communications, earth observation and global navigation satellite systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>These procurements have not been covered for <abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> suppliers between January 1, 2021 and April 1, 2021 as neither the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> nor <abbr title="Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement">CETA</abbr> were in force for government procurement obligations between Canada and the <abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr>.</p>
<p><strong>If a procurement is subject to the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr>, contracting officers must ensure that the Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> is indicated on any tender notices</strong>. The Canada-<abbr title="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland">UK</abbr> <abbr title="Trade Continuity Agreement">TCA</abbr> will also need to be indicated for reporting purposes. </p>
<p><strong>There will be no other changes to the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Acquisitions Program procurement process resulting from the entry into force of this agreement.</strong></p>
