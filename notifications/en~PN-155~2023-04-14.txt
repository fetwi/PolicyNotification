<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification (PN)-155 is to introduce a new series of pricing clauses to support the use of the <a href="https://canadabuys.canada.ca/en/how-procurement-works/policies-and-guidelines/pricing-framework#pricing_guide">Practitioner’s Guide for Procurement Pricing</a> by Public Works and Government Services Canada Acquisitions Program (AP) contracting officers.</p>
<p><abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>-155 provides updates to the Supply Manual and updates the Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual to add a new 8000 series of pricing clauses recommended for use by <abbr title="Acquisitions Program">AP</abbr> contracting officers in conjunction with the <a href="https://canadabuys.canada.ca/en/how-procurement-works/policies-and-guidelines/pricing-framework#pricing_guide">Practitioner’s Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>.</p>
<h3>Effective date</h3>
<p><abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>-155 is effective immediately.</p>
<h3>Expected outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increase awareness of leading pricing practices to support current guidance in procurement to maximize value for Canadians;</li>
<li>Add pricing clauses designed to yield, in particular cases, substantial advantages to the buyer and the supplier and motivate contractors’ performance and competitiveness;</li>
<li>Strengthen Canada’s capability and capacity to manage pricing throughout the lifecycle of a contract, contributing to sound stewardship of public funds, procurement modernization and modern comptrollership; and</li>
<li>Introduce a new series of pricing clauses and processes for use by the contracting officers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>As a result of an independent study dated December 2015 (<a href="https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/amd-dp/samd-dps/reponse-respond-eng.html" rel="external">Department’s response</a>), several components of Canada’s pricing framework are being adapted to incorporate innovative pricing practices, more flexibility and greater options for strategic pricing, and to align pricing with desired procurement performance objectives to achieve best value for Canadians.</p>
<p>Several consultations held since then have provided insights and best practices on the application of pricing and profit principles to support the delivery of optimal value especially in negotiated contracts. This involves determining a contract price when market prices are not available and/or negotiated pricing is required.</p>
<p>This <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr> provides new standard clauses to be used in support of the guidance outlined in the <a href="https://canadabuys.canada.ca/en/how-procurement-works/policies-and-guidelines/pricing-framework#pricing_guide">Practitioner’s Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>.</p>
<h3>Requirements and responsibility</h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Acquisitions Program">AP</abbr> contracting officer leads the development of the procurement process and a key element of this process is to establish the contract price. Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) has dedicated in-house Chartered Professional Accountants (CPAs) for the provision of financial expertise to assist <abbr title="Acquisitions Program">AP</abbr> contracting officers as required or as stipulated in the <a class="gov" href="https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/d/d0/Directive_on_the_Use_of_Cost_and_Price_Analysis_FINAL_EN.pdf" rel="external">Directive on the Use of Cost and Price Analysis Services</a><span> (accessible only on the Government of Canada network)</span> (<abbr title="portable document format">PDF</abbr> file – 314KB) (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-services-procurement/services/acquisitions/better-buying/reducing-barriers/improving-accessibility.html">Help on File Formats</a>) and <a class="gov" href="https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/d/dd/Guideline_on_the_Use_of_Cost_and_Profit_Analysis_FINAL_EN.pdf" rel="external">Guideline on the Use of Cost and Price Analysis Services</a><span> (accessible only on the Government of Canada network)</span> (<abbr title="portable document format">PDF</abbr> file – 321KB)  (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-services-procurement/services/acquisitions/better-buying/reducing-barriers/improving-accessibility.html">Help on File Formats</a>). </p>
<p>Once the pricing approach is authorized through standard procurement approval process, the contracting officer will include all appropriate clauses for the basis of payment chosen. The contracting officer will also ensure all aspects of the price are clearly documented in the contract such as in an Annex. A detailed breakdown of the cost, profit and incentives should be included in the contract Basis of Payment section, where applicable.</p>
<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://canadabuys.canada.ca/en/how-procurement-works/policies-and-guidelines/pricing-framework#pricing_guide">Practitioner’s Guide for Procurement Pricing</a> provides more information on building a common understanding among all stakeholders in regards to pricing components and options.  This includes guidance on risk sharing, responsibilities and the encouragement of innovation through the use of pricing approach. More specifically, Sections 4 and 5 of the new guidance relating to basis of payment, incentives, costing, profit determination and the use of alternative pricing approaches complement Chapters 4 and 10 of the Supply Manual.</p>
<p>The updates to the Supply Manual and the <abbr title="Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual referred to in this <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr> support the approaches outlined in the <a href="https://canadabuys.canada.ca/en/how-procurement-works/policies-and-guidelines/pricing-framework#pricing_guide">Practitioner’s Guide for Procurement Pricing</a>.</p>
