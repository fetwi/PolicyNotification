<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification (PN)-143 is to inform Acquisitions Program (AP) contracting officers of Supply Manual updates to the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) processes outlined in Chapter 9.15.</p>
<h3>Effective date</h3>
<p>This policy notification is effective immediately. </p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program is a form of security assistance authorized by the United States Government’s (USG’s) <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title22/chapter39&amp;edition=prelim" rel="external">Arms Export Control Act</a> (AECA) that allows allies of the United States (US) to procure export controlled defence goods and services of <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> origin. </p>
<p>Executed by the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> Department of Defense (DoD), the <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> program enables Canada to acquire defence goods and services that are export-controlled from the United States Government (USG) through a government-to-government agreement referred to as Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA). </p>
<p>The <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> program is a mutually beneficial government-to-government method for the procurement of export-controlled <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> defence articles and services. Responsible arms sales furthers <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> national security and foreign policy objectives by strengthening bilateral defence relations, which support coalition building, and enhance interoperability between <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> forces and military partners and allies. In the case of purchasing countries, <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> allows access to otherwise controlled technologies, and extensive <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> supply chains. Leveraging the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> procurement regime may also offer savings through economies of scale, procurement risk mitigation, and additional oversight.</p>
<p>As the sole delegated Contracting Authority for <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> acquisitions, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Washington Sector [PWGSC (W)] is responsible for entering into government-to-government agreements with the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> Department of Defense (DoD). <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> (<abbr title="Washington">W</abbr>) is responsible for entry into agreement, amendment, transportation, contract management, and monitoring <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> policy changes related to <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> acquisitions. </p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    This policy notification provides an update to the processes outlined within the Supply Manual for <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> acquisitions. The summary of the changes made are as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>Section <a href="https://canadabuys.canada.ca/en/how-procurement-works/policies-and-guidelines/supply-manual/chapter-2#_2-30">2.30.1 Funding</a> of the Supply Manual has been amended to provide Clients with an option to submit requisitions for <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> acquisitions in United States Dollars (USD). Given all <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> government-to-government agreements are in <abbr title="United States Dollars">USD</abbr> this amendment will provide <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> (<abbr title="Washington">W</abbr>) with sufficient funding to manage agreements throughout their duration, and provide Clients with the ability to manage any exchange rate fluctuations in house.</li>
<li><abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> acquisition processes have been updated to accurately reflect day-to-day processes. <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Headquarters [PWGSC (H)] contracting officers are requested to seek advice from <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> (<abbr title="Washington">W</abbr>) on new acquisitions that may involve procuring goods or services through the US <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> Program. </li>
<li>Third Party Transfer (TPT) processes have been added to provide clients and <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting officers with guidelines on how to proceed. </li>
<li>The difference between <abbr title="Foreign Military Sales">FMS</abbr> and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) has been added.</li>
</ol>
