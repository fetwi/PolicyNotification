<p>On December 30, 1996, the policy notification for the Shipbuilding, Repair, Refit and Modernization policy was distributed. This notification included the introduction of clause A0240T.</p>
<p>Subsequent discussion with legal counsel and Marine Directorate has resulted in minor modifications to the clause. The revised version of A0240T (Annex A) is attached and will be included in the next amendment to the SACC, scheduled for June 1997.</p>
<p>Two modifications have been made to Section 3 of A0240T.</p>
<p>1. Fill-ins have been added before note 1, allowing the contracting authority to indicate the type of vessel and the home port.</p>
<p>2. Note 1 is modified to clarify crew transportation costs being applicable for unmanned refits only and not when responsibility for care &amp; custody of the vessel is being retained by the Crown.</p>
<h2>Annex B</h2>
<p><strong>Remarks:</strong> Contracting officers shall use the latest table (Eastern Canada or Western Canada) approved by the Director, Marine Directorate, to prepare the list of shipyard/shiprepair facilities, as required under section 3 of this clause, where the work could potentially be undertaken. Contracting officers are to include from the table the applicable vessel transfer costs for each shipyard/shiprepair facility in the list based on the vessel's home port location and based on whether the work is under a manned refit. Where the table does not provide a specific home port for the vessel or the name of a potential shipyard/shiprepair facility where work could potentially be undertaken, contracting officers must contact the Director, Marine Directorate (Place du Portage, Phase III - 6C2, Phone: 819-956-0664, Fax: 819-956-0897) to obtain the necessary data.</p>
<p>Contracting officers are to enter the number of calendar days in subsection 2(b).</p>
