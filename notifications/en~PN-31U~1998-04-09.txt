<p>We have been advised by Treasury Board Secretariat that the deadline for inclusion of a clause to comply with the<br/>
					services payment reporting requirement has been extended to May 1, 1998. We know that changes will be required as to the application<br/>
					and the clause, but since a number of issues remain unresolved, we have decided to suspend implementation of our directive until we are in<br/>
					a position to make all appropriate changes to the directive and to our <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions</em> clause H3023D, hopefully<br/>
					before the new implementation date of May 1, 1998.</p>
