<h4>K4000D Canadian Content Definition</h4>
<p>1. Canadian Good: A good wholly manufactured or originating in Canada is considered a Canadian good. A product containing imported components may also be considered Canadian for the purpose of this policy when it has undergone sufficient change in Canada, in a manner that satisfies the definition specified under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Rules of Origin. For photocopiers, computers and office equipment within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) groups 36, 70 and 74, only the products of MERIT/CIRCLE firms or companies in Priority Group 1 prior to April 1992 are considered Canadian (see below the paragraph on MERIT Partnership Program and CIRCLE Program).</p>
<p>2. Canadian Service: A service provided by an individual based in Canada is considered a Canadian service. Where a requirement consists of only one service, which is being provided by more than one individual, the service will be considered Canadian if a minimum of 80 percent of the total bid price for the service is provided by individuals based in Canada.</p>
<p>3. Variety of Goods: When requirements consist of more than one good:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Aggregate Evaluation: no less than 80 percent of the total bid price must consist of Canadian goods; or,</li>
<li>Item by Item Evaluation: In some cases, the bid evaluation may be conducted on an item-by-item basis and contracts may be awarded to more than one supplier. In these cases, suppliers will be asked to identify separately each item that meets the definition of Canadian goods.</li>
</ol>
<p>4. Variety of Services: For requirements consisting of more than one service, a minimum of 80 percent of the total bid price must be provided by personnel based in Canada.</p>
<p>5. Mix of Goods and Services: Except for science and technology requirements (see paragraph 6 (a) below), when requirements consist of a mix of goods and services, no less than 80 percent of the total bid price must consist of Canadian Goods and Canadian Services (as defined above).</p>
<p>6. Other Canadian Goods and Services:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Science and Technology Contracting-Out Policy: Treasury Board's Science and Technology Contracting-Out Policy sets out the basis for competing the science and technology requirements of the federal government. Science and technology requirements may be sourced exclusively from Canadian suppliers. The percentage of the total bid price that must consist of Canadian goods and/or services will be 80 percent, unless otherwise stated in the Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP) and solicitation document.</li>
<li>MERIT Partnership Program and CIRCLE Program: For photocopiers, computers and office equipment within FSC groups 36, 70 and 74, only the products of the following firms are considered Canadian goods:<br/>
<ol type="i">
<li>MERIT Partners under the MERIT Partnership Program (sponsored by Industry Canada (IC));</li>
<li>Companies which, on March 31, 1992, were allocated to Priority Group 1 under the Priority Groups Policy in effect at that time; or</li>
<li>CIRCLE companies as agreed on by IC and PWGSC.</li>
</ol>
<p>						Further information regarding the MERIT and CIRCLE programs may be obtained from Industry Canada, Information Technologies Industry Branch, Ottawa, Ontario, 613-952-8420.</p></li>
<li>Motor Vehicles: Motor vehicles are considered to be Canadian goods for the purpose of the Canadian Content policy if they qualify for purchase under the provisions identifying vehicles normally purchased in Canada as set out in Treasury Board Manual, Information and Administrative Management, Materiel, Risk and Common Services, Part I, Chapter 2.</li>
<li>Textiles: Textiles are considered to be Canadian goods according to a modified rule of origin, copies of which are available from the Clothing and Textiles Division, Industrial and Commercial Products and Standardization Services Sector.</li>

<h3>Annex B</h3>
<h4>Changes to the Supply Manual</h4>
<p>(Changes are effective immediately. Changes will appear in the December 1996 Release of the Supply Manual)</p>
<p>5.072 A good wholly manufactured or originating in Canada is considered a Canadian good. A product containing imported components may also be considered Canadian for the purpose of this policy when it has undergone sufficient change in Canada, in a manner that satisfies the definition specified under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Rules of Origin. For photocopiers, computers and office equipment within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) groups 36, 70 and 74, only the products of MERIT/CIRCLE firms or companies in Priority Group 1 prior to April 1992 are considered Canadian (see below the paragraph on MERIT Partnership Program and CIRCLE Program).</p>
<p>A service provided by an individual based in Canada is considered a Canadian service. Where a requirement consists of only one service, which is being provided by more than one individual, the service will be considered Canadian if a minimum of 80 percent of the total bid price for the service is provided by individuals based in Canada.</p>
<p>5.073 Other Canadian Goods and Services:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Treasury Board's Science and Technology Contracting-Out Policy sets out the basis for competing the science and technology requirements of the federal government. Science and technology requirements may be sourced exclusively from Canadian suppliers. The percentage of the total bid price that must consist of Canadian goods and/or services will be 80 percent unless otherwise stated in the Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP) and solicitation document.</li>
<li>MERIT Partnership Program and CIRCLE Program: For photocopiers, computers and office equipment within FSC groups 36, 70 and 74, only the products of the following firms are considered Canadian goods:<br/>
<ol type="i">
<li>MERIT Partners under the MERIT Partnership Program (sponsored by Industry Canada (IC));</li>
<li>Companies which, on March 31,1992 were allocated to Priority Group 1 under the Priority Groups Policy in effect at that time; or</li>
<li>CIRCLE companies as agreed on by IC and PWGSC.</li>
</ol>
<p>						Further information regarding the MERIT and CIRCLE programs may be obtained from Industry Canada, Information Technologies Industry Branch, Ottawa, Ontario 613-952-8420.</p></li>
<li>Motor vehicles are considered to be Canadian goods for the purpose of this policy if they qualify for purchase under the provisions identifying vehicles normally purchased in Canada as set out in Treasury Board (TB) Manual, Information and Administrative Management, Materiel, Services &amp; Risk Management, Part I, Chapter 2.</li>
<li>Textiles are considered to be Canadian goods according to a modified rule of origin, copies of which are available from the Clothing and Textiles Division, Industrial and Commercial Porducts and Standardization Services Sector.</li>
</ol>
<p>7.366 (01/07/95) When requirements consist of more than one good, the evaluation of Canadian content certification can be done the following ways:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Aggregate: a minimum of 80 percent of the total bid price must consist of Canadian goods; or,</li>
<li>Item by Item: The bid certification is conducted on an item-by-item basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>For requirements consisting of more than one service, a minimum of 80 percent of the total bid price must be provided by personnel based in Canada.</p>
<p>Except for science and technology requirements (see 5.073a)), when requirements consist of a mix of goods and services, 80 percent of the total bid price must consist of Canadian goods and Canadian services.</p>
<p>A bid can be accepted in part without resubmission of a certification.</p>
<p>7.368 The onus is on the supplier to demonstrate that its bid meets the definition of Canadian goods and services. The supplier must execute and submit the certification form with bid (see also 5.074). When the SACC Manual clauses K4003T, K4004T, K4005T or K4006T (Individual Item Evaluation) are used, the supplier must clearly identify the status of each individual product.</p>
