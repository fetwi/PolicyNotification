<p>Previous policy notifications 31, 31R, and 31R1 reflected Public Works and Government Services Canada's (PWGSC) decision to adopt the invoicing procedure approach to make contractors provide the required information directly to client departments via the invoicing procedure.</p>
<p>However, since Treasury Board has allowed departments and agencies to establish whatever method is most appropriate to their circumstances to comply with the T4A reporting requirement, we would like to provide standard clauses that can accommodate methods of obtaining contractor information other than the invoicing procedures. For example, we are aware that some departments would prefer to have the required information forwarded by the contractor directly to their specific contact point, following the date of award. Others (e.g. <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Financial Operations) propose to request the information from applicable vendors in its departmental payment system by call-letter on an annual basis prior to the end of each calendar year. Client departments should indicate in their requisitions how they want this information so that the appropriate clauses may be used. To accommodate these other methods of obtaining the information, we are proposing a separate clause (A9115D) that advises contractors of their obligation to provide identifying information to client departments, to be followed by a subsequent clause which tells them how they are required to provide the information for the particular requirement. Three clauses will reflect the options available to clients which are:</p>
<p>1. <strong>H3023D</strong> - Information to be provided with invoice (with first invoice should be sufficient);</p>
<p>2. <strong>A9116D</strong> - Information forwarded directly to client specified contact within X number of days after contract award (or call up);</p>
<p>3. <strong>A9117D</strong> - As and when requested directly by the client department (general or individual call letter or any other contact by client department).</p>
<p>Also, to address the confidential nature of some information, namely the Social Information Number, it has been decided to require that the contractor identifying information be provided to each client in an envelope marked "protected".</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Since clauses A9115D/A9117D are informative in nature, it is not mandatory that they be used. Although their use would ensure a uniform approach across Supply Operations Service Branch, Sectors wishing to use other means of communicating the relevant information, for example notices, information bulletins or other, can do so.</p>
<p>The clauses provided in <strong>Annex A</strong>, will be incorporated to the <em>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions</em> Manual, in amendment 98-3, which is scheduled for release on November 23, 1998.</p>
<h4>Annex A</h4>

This includes contracts or standing offers with Canadians undertaking government work abroad. It is to be used in conjunction with either H3023D, A9116D, or A9117D, as applicable.</p>
