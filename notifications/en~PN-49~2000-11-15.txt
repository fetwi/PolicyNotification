<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>The revised policy on <em>Title to Intellectual Property Arising<br/>
					under Crown Procurement Contracts</em>, sponsored by Industry<br/>
					Canada, was approved by Treasury Board (TB) June 1, 2000. The<br/>
					revised Policy, which supersedes the less well-elaborated 1991<br/>
					Policy, realizes a Red Book commitment to strengthen the potential<br/>
					for commercial exploitation by the private sector of intellectual<br/>
					property (IP) developed under contract with the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Supply Policy Directorate (SPD) has been a member of the working<br/>
					group that developed the new Intellectual Property (IP) Policy.<br/>
					Our goal has been to ensure that the Policy will be implementable<br/>
					and to incorporate in the Policy support for the approach Public<br/>
					Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) took to implement<br/>
					the 1991 Policy in contracts. SPD, together with Legal Services,<br/>
					has drafted Model Clauses for IP to assist departments in revising<br/>
					their contract terms and to ensure consistency with the revised<br/>
					Policy. It is expected that the effect of the Policy revision on<br/>
					Supply Operations common service organization function should be<br/>
					minimal, as the most important changes are to the exceptions which<br/>
					allow Crown ownership of IP. As with the 1991 Policy, the decision<br/>
					on ownership is that of the client department.</p>
<p>The approach taken in 1991 was to recognize that departments'<br/>
					primary interest in procurement is in supporting their operations,<br/>
					that the Policy did not require that departments compromise their<br/>
					operations in order to promote commercialization of IP and that<br/>
					IP should be commercialized by the private sector. From this, we<br/>
					concluded that we should aim to facilitate contractor ownership<br/>
					while maintaining departments' ability to use the IP for their<br/>
					own operations much as if the Crown had owned the IP. The methods<br/>
					used were to make contractor ownership the default position in<br/>
					the Research &amp; Development General Conditions (DSS-MAS 9624)<br/>
					and by writing IP terms that would provide the Crown with broad<br/>
					rights to use the IP. By giving the Crown the right to use the<br/>
					IP much as if the Crown owned the IP, it was hoped that reluctance<br/>
					on the part of clients to allow the contractor to own the IP, based<br/>
					on concern for their operations, would be reduced.</p>
<h3>Policy</h3>
<p>The new Policy is essentially the same as the old Policy (1991)<br/>
					in that it maintains the presumption that IP is best commercialized<br/>
					by the private sector, and that ownership by the private sector<br/>
					is generally necessary to allow that commercialization. The new<br/>
					Policy takes a much more rigorous approach than the old Policy.<br/>
					While the old Policy effectively allows departments to claim ownership<br/>
					of IP developed under contract whenever they wish to do so, the<br/>
					new policy imposes a closed list of exceptions to contractor-owned<br/>
					IP. A table comparing the exceptions allowing Crown-owned IP under<br/>
					the 1991 and 2000 policies is attached at Appendix A. Under the<br/>
					new Policy, a department wishing to own IP, under circumstances<br/>
					that do not fall within one of the exceptions, will have to make<br/>
					a TB submission to obtain approval.</p>

<h3>Implementation of the Policy</h3>
<p>The new Policy is being implemented using a phased approach. All<br/>
					ownership decisions taken on or after October 1, 2000, and all<br/>
					Request for Proposals (RFPs) and contracts issued on or after December<br/>
					31, 2000, must be in compliance with the new Policy. This phased<br/>
					approach is to allow adequate time for training and orientation<br/>
					for an effective implementation. It is recognized that some projects<br/>
					with very long lead times may run into problems where the ownership<br/>
					decision is made before October 1, 2000, but the contract is not<br/>
					issued until on or after January 1, 2001. A department which has<br/>
					selected Crown-owned IP under an exception to the 1991 Policy and<br/>
					cannot justify the decision on the basis of the exceptions to the<br/>
					2000 Policy will have to make a TB submission to cover the ownership<br/>
					decision.</p>
<p>The new Policy requires that Departments collect information on<br/>
					the use of exceptions allowing for Crown-owned IP. The IP report<br/>
					will be an element of the existing TB contracting reports. The<br/>
					Supply Systems Directorate of Supply Operations Service Branch<br/>
					is working to prepare for implementation of the reporting requirement,<br/>
					scheduled to begin January 1, 2001. The contracting officer will<br/>
					be able to indicate whether the IP will be contractor-owned or<br/>
					Crown-owned (and if so, under what exception) by making a choice<br/>
					from a drop down list in the Automated Buyer Environment system.</p>
<h3>Supply Manual:</h3>
<p>The revisions to the Supply Manual are attached at Appendix B.<br/>
					These revisions will be incorporated into the next Supply Manual<br/>
					amendment, scheduled to be released in the first quarter of 2001.</p>
<h3>Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) Manual:</h3>
<p>SPD and Legal Services are amending the SACC Manual to produce<br/>
					new IP terms (General Conditions, Supplemental General Conditions<br/>
					and clauses) that will allow contracting officers to continue doing<br/>
					as they have been with a minimum of disruption, but incorporating<br/>
					the experience that the Department have gained over the past 8<br/>
					years. These revised IP terms will be incorporated into the next<br/>
					SACC amendment, scheduled to be released in the first quarter of<br/>
					2001.</p>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> Modifications to a number of IP<br/>
					clauses will appear in Amendment 00-2 of the SACC Manual, to be<br/>
					released in December. These modifications are housekeeping changes<br/>
					and <strong>are not</strong> the new IP terms referred to above.</p>
<p>Until then, contracting officers are to continue to use the existing<br/>
					IP terms, including those for real property contracting. These<br/>
					terms allow contracting officers to assemble contracts which are<br/>
					consistent with the revised IP Policy. A concordance table of the<br/>
					current IP terms and the Model Clauses is attached at Appendix<br/>
					C. This concordance table is to aid contracting officers in dealing<br/>
					with clients and in structuring contracts. As in any case in the<br/>
					past, where a client department has a specific need not met by<br/>
					the use of standard terms, advice from Legal Services should be<br/>
					sought. The Model Clause language may be used as a basis for custom<br/>
					terms in such cases.</p>
<p>To deal with requisitions where the client department has made<br/>
					its IP ownership decision based on the revised 2000 IP Policy rather<br/>
					than the 1991 Policy, a revised clause K3200T is attached at Appendix<br/>
					D. Where the client department indicates a reason for Crown ownership<br/>
					based on the 1991 Policy, the current version of K3200T in the<br/>
					SACC Manual should be used.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX B</h2>
<h3>Revisions to the Supply Manual</h3>
<p> 6.174 (xx/xx/xx) "<strong>Policy - Objectives and Underlying<br/>
					Principles</strong></p>
<p><em>"10. Like the 1991 policy, the revised policy aims to increase<br/>
					commercialization of IP. It recognizes that commercial exploitation<br/>
					of IP can contribute to economic growth and job creation by having<br/>
					contractors own the IP they create in the course of their work<br/>
					under Crown procurement contracts, and it also recognizes that<br/>
					there will be instances where the Crown will need to retain the<br/>
					IP in order to act in the broader public interest.</em></p>
<p><em>11. It further recognizes that the objective of commercializing<br/>
					IP from government contracts takes place within the framework<br/>
					of the government's Contracting Policy and its provisions with<br/>
					respect to socio-economic objectives.</em></p>
<p><em>12. Most importantly, the revised policy recognizes that the<br/>
					primary objective of Crown procurement contracts is for the Crown<br/>
					to receive the deliverables contracted for, and to be able to<br/>
					use those deliverables and any arising IP for Government of Canada<br/>
					activities."</em></p>
<p class="alignRight"><em>(Derived from TBS Contracting Policy Notice<br/>
					2000-2,<br/>
					July 17, 2000</em>)</p>
<p>Intellectual property (IP) is anything resulting from a contract<br/>
					which can be copyrighted, trademarked, patented, licensed, etc.<br/>
					Potentially, IP can result from any contract. The likelihood for<br/>
					IP is much greater where the goal of the contract is something<br/>
					new, or might incorporate new processes. IP considerations are<br/>
					most relevant to research and development contracts, software development,<br/>
					or where the production of new written material occurs.</p>
<p>The government policy of allowing the contractor to retain the<br/>
					rights to IP generated under a Crown contract is designed to promote<br/>
					the development of new ideas, under the belief that the private<br/>
					sector has a greater capacity to commercialize and benefit from<br/>
					the IP. The Crown will not arbitrarily refuse to allow a contractor<br/>
					to retain the rights to IP.</p>
<p>The client department must decide to what extent IP rights are<br/>
					to be retained by the Crown, and <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> plays no part in this determination.<br/>
					However, the contracting officer must consult with the client department<br/>
					in the case of research and development or software development<br/>
					procurements, to determine the client department's position. Contracting<br/>
					officers may wish to discuss their needs with client departments<br/>
					to ensure that client departments are aware of the extent to which<br/>
					we can obtain for them the rights they need to use the IP created<br/>
					under their contract whether the Crown or Contractor owns the IP.<br/>
					Subject to market conditions (which will also affect the ownership<br/>
					terms that may be achieved) <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> contract terms are designed with<br/>
					the goal of ensuring that even where the contractor owns the IP<br/>
					this does not affect the client department's ability to use the<br/>
					IP, with the exception of commercialization of the IP by the Crown.</p>
<p>Client department may deal with IP rights in several ways:</p>
<p>Research and Development (R&amp;D) contracts</p>
<ul>
<li>Contractor to retain ownership of IP</li>
<li>Crown to retain ownership of IP</li>
</ul>
<p>Goods contract with associated R&amp;D</p>
<ul>
<li>Contractor to retain ownership of IP</li>
<li>Crown to retain ownership of IP</li>
</ul>
<p>Goods contract with no R&amp;D expected</p>
<ul>
<li>Crown to retain copyright</li>
<li>Contractor to retain all IP, including copyright</li>
</ul>
<p>Services contract with no R&amp;D expected</p>
<ul>
<li>Crown to retain copyright</li>
<li>Contractor to retain all IP, including copyright</li>
</ul>
<h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>7.070 (xx/xx/xx) The bid solicitation should make clear to potential<br/>
					bidders the ownership of any IP rights, as determined by the client<br/>
					department. SACC Manual clauses may be used in conjunction with<br/>
					the General Conditions and Supplemental General Conditions to meet<br/>
					the client department's requirement (re: Annex 7.5). In the case<br/>
					of low-dollar value procurements which use General Conditions DSS-MAS<br/>
					9329 or DSS-MAS 9628, the contract would generally be silent on<br/>
					IP, with the usual result being that the contractor would own any<br/>
					IP they develop.</p>
<p>7.570 (xx/xx/xx) Unless there has been a change in the client<br/>
					department's IP position from the bid solicitation, contracting<br/>
					officers must use, in the contract, the identical clauses used<br/>
					in the bid solicitation, <strong>with the exception of clause K3200T,<br/>
					which is needed only at the bid solicitation stage</strong> (re:<br/>
					Annex 7.5).</p>
<p>7.575 (xx/xx/xx) Starting January 1, 2001, each department will<br/>
					have to maintain a record of all contracts valued over the threshold<br/>
					for solicitation of bids as set out in the Government Contracting<br/>
					Regulations. Each department will have to specify the contracts<br/>
					that are contractor-owned IP and that are Crown-owned IP and the<br/>
					exception(s) invoked (the same reason used in clause K3200T). The<br/>
					report will be rolled up with the TB report on contracting.</p>
<h3>Annex 7.5: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAUSES</h3>
<p>An amendment to this Annex will be released at the same time as<br/>
					the new clauses are released.</p>
