<div class="field field-name-field-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden">
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification 133 (PN-133) is to notify all Acquisitions Program (AP) contracting officers of a new policy on the Cost Accounting Practices (CAP) Submission. This <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr> supports the <a class="gov" href="http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/d/d0/Directive_on_the_Use_of_Cost_and_Price_Analysis_FINAL_EN.pdf" rel="external">Directive on the Use of Cost and Price Analysis Services</a><span> (accessible only on the Government of Canada network)</span>.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission is a mechanism that can be used prior to, or in connection with, solicitations or contract negotiations where contract pricing is based on estimated or actual costs determined in accordance with Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (SACC) General Condition <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a> Contract Cost Principles. </p>
<p>The <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission serves to clarify the application of <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> General Condition 1031-2 and formally document the cost accounting practices to be used by a supplier for contract pricing.  An accepted <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission evidenced by a <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Acceptance Letter, will be incorporated into the terms and conditions of a contract if the requirement for one is expressly stated prior to contract award or by contract amendment.</p>
<h2>Effective date</h2>
<p><abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>-133 is effective immediately.</p>
<h2>Expected outcome</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission supports the Government of Canada’s objective to achieve best value for money in contracts - in a manner that is fair and reasonable to the contractors by providing greater clarity, consistency, fairness and transparency in the application of <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> General Condition <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a>.</p>
<h2>Background and context</h2>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/amd-dp/samd-dps/reponse-respond-eng.html" rel="external">Department’s response</a>, a third-party review from December 2015 concluded that Canada’s Contract Cost Principles were sound and compared favourably with costing standards applied by other nations.  At the same time, the findings indicated that guidance material and tools were necessary in order to explain the application of Canada’s cost-based pricing approach as well as alternatives for all applicable procurements.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission set forth in this PN represents a measure that may be used to facilitate consistency in cost-based pricing and improve understanding and transparency on the acceptability of costs, while addressing industry’s expectations for a clear and consistent approach with regard to pricing and payment risks. </p>
<h2>Requirements and responsibility</h2>
<h3>Application of the <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission</h3>
<p>At the discretion of the contracting officer (in consultation with a price advisor from Procurement Support Services Sector (PSSS)) the requirement for an accepted <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission evidenced by a <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Acceptance Letter can be used in a competitive or non-competitive solicitation where pricing is, or will be based on estimated or actual costs in accordance with <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> General Condition <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a> Contract Cost Principles and clarification of the cost accounting practices to be used for pricing is desired. </p>
<p>The <a class="gov" href="http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/d/d0/Directive_on_the_Use_of_Cost_and_Price_Analysis_FINAL_EN.pdf" rel="external">Directive on the Use of Cost and Price Analysis Services</a><span> (accessible only on the Government of Canada network)</span> remains in effect and sets out the conditions under which the use of cost and price analysis services is mandatory. </p>
<p>To satisfy a <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission requirement, a supplier can either provide a <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Acceptance Letter or refer to an existing <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Acceptance Letter in responding to a solicitation where the <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission is a requirement. </p>
<p>A supplier may submit a <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission for evaluation in anticipation of future requirements at any time. </p>
<p>When a supplier wishes to propose a change to accounting practices that differs from a previously accepted <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission, a new <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission must be submitted by that supplier for evaluation. </p>
<p>An accepted <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission that has a valid <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Acceptance Letter may be incorporated if desired, by way of amendment to existing contracts.  </p>
<p>When a <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission is completed, signed by an authorized representative of the supplier and received, the <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Evaluation Committee will evaluate the submission and determine by consensus decision whether the bidder or offeror’s cost accounting practices are acceptable to Canada, as outlined in the <a class="gov" href="https://gcdocs.gc.ca/tpsgc-pwgsc/llisapi.dll?func=ll&amp;objaction=overview&amp;objid=227384285" rel="external">Cost Accounting Practices Submission Evaluation Process</a><span> (accessible only on the Government of Canada network)</span>. The <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Evaluation Committee will inform the supplier of acceptance or non-acceptance of the accounting practices described in the <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission by letter.</p>
<p>Once incorporated as part of the terms of a contract, the accepted <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission will apply for the life of the contract. The new <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> clause, <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/5/C/C0014C/active">C0014C</a>, incorporates the cost accounting practices as terms of the contract.  </p>
<p>A <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Acceptance Letter remains valid for a period of three (3) years from the date of issuance and may be provided in responding to a <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission requirement.  After the expiration of this three (3) year period, a new <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission is required to obtain a valid <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Acceptance Letter for new solicitations where the <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission is a requirement.</p>
<p>Canada reserves the right to revoke the <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission Acceptance Letter at any time if it is determined that the <abbr title="Cost Accounting Practices">CAP</abbr> Submission or practice is no longer in compliance with <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> General Condition <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/standard-acquisition-clauses-and-conditions-manual/3/1031-2/active">1031-2</a>.</p>
