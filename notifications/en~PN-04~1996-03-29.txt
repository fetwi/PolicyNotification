<p>On April 1, 1996 the Treasury Board Payment on Due Date (PODD) Policy was revised. Interest on overdue accounts will now be paid at 3% plus the average Bank of Canada bank rate over the month preceding payment. In addition, the current 15-day interest-free grace period will be eliminated. Contractors will be paid interest automatically for the entire period, where payment is made after the 45<sup>th</sup> day. However, the centralized PODD system cannot calculate the interest owed when payment is made after the 30<sup>th</sup> day but before the 45<sup>th</sup> day. Changes to the system are not contemplated for several years. Therefore, contractors must request payment of interest on a case-by-case basis when payment has been made between the 30<sup>th</sup> and 45<sup>th</sup> days.</p>
<p>To reflect the change in the PODD policy on April 1, 1996, the clauses below are to be used in all contracts other than those using Real Property Contracting Services' Standard Instructions, Terms and Conditions. Clauses for use in Real Property Contracting Services' Standard Instructions, Terms and Conditions will follow.</p>
<p>Please have the clause below, entitled "Interest on Overdue Accounts" (Annex A) used in all solicitations, Standing Offers and contracts issued after April 1, 1996.</p>
<p>Any contract amended for other reasons or renewed on or after April 1, 1996 must be amended to include the clause below (Annex B), entitled "Interest on Overdue Accounts - Amendment".</p>
<p>In any situation where H0002D is used now,use the appropriate clause below, with "Contractor" changed to "Carrier."</p>

<li>"date of payment" means the date of the negotiable instrument drawn by the Receiver General for Canada and given for payment of an amount due and payable;</li>
<li>an amount is "due and payable" when it is due and payable by Canada to the Contractor in accordance with the terms of the Contract; and</li>
