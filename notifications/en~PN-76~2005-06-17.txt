<p>The <em>Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions</em> (SACC) Manual update, Version 05-1 released June 10, 2005, issued a revised version of clauses M0000T and M0000C.  A problem has been identified in the wording of the revised version which makes it improper to use the clauses as revised.  As a result, the revised versions of clauses M0000T and M0000C released on June 10, 2005, are temporarily put on hold. </p>
<p>Effective immediately, clauses M0000T and M0000C bearing the date "2005-06-10" shall not be used.  Contracting officers shall continue to use the prior version of these clauses until further notice: M0000T, released May 14, 2004; and M0000C, released December 12, 2003, which are either available electronically on the SACC Manual web site or as attached in AnnexÂ A.</p>
<p>Contracting officers are advised that this is a temporary measure.  Acquisition Policy is continuing to work on the wording and will publish revised clauses shortly.</p>
