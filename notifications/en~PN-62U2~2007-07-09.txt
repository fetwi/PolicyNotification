<h5>Transportation Information</h5>
<p id="PN-62U2a6e_622">6E.622 (xxxx-xx-xx) The Incoterms 2000 "FCA Free Carrier (… named place)" must be used in all Department of National Defence (DND) sole source contracts, all repair and overhaul contracts where transportation is not part of the competitive bid<em>, and in all United States (U.S.) Foreign Military Sales contracts (not all U.S. contracts)</em>. DND will manage the inbound logistics (coordinate, arrange and pay for all inbound transportation) for these contracts.</p>
<p>For these contracts, the contractor is to deliver these goods "FCA free carrier", and the named place will always be the contractor's facility, unless specified otherwise by DND. The contracting officer must include in the contract either <em>Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions</em> (SACC) Manual transportation clause <em><a href="#PN-62U2aD0035C">D0035C</a> or <a href="#PN-62U2aD0037C">D0037C</a></em>. These clauses direct the contractor to obtain shipping instructions from DND and how to do so. </p>
<p>If the contractor is not located in Canada, <em>and the goods are to be imported into Canada by DND</em>, the contracting officer must include SACC Manual clause <a href="#PN-62U2aC2608C">C2608C</a> and, when applicable, clause C2610D. <em>If the goods are to be imported into Canada by the contractor, include clause C2601D, if applicable.</em></p>
