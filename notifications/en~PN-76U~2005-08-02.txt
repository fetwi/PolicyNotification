<p>Effective immediately, contracting officers may use clauses M0000T and M0000C bearing the date "2005-06-10", in conjunction with a new clause M0100D, provided at Annex A.    Contracting officers must use the new clause M0100D in their standing offer documents, in conjunction with either M0000T or M0000C as appropriate, in order to incorporate 9403-6, Standard Instructions and Conditions - Standing Offers, by reference.  The clauses must appear in full text within procurement documents.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The <em>Standard Acquisitions Clauses and Conditions</em> (SACC) Manual Version 05-1, published on June 10, 2005, issued a revised version of clauses M0000T and M0000C.  A problem was subsequently identified in the wording of these clauses, which made it improper to use them as revised.  As a temporary solution, PN-76 advised contracting officers that the June 10, 2005, version of these clauses was temporarily put on hold and contracting officers were to use the prior version of these clauses.   Since then, a new clause, M0100D, has been developed as a solution to the wording problem.  The June 10, 2005, versions of clauses M0000T and M0000C are now reinstated and are to be used in conjunction with the new clause M0100D.</p>
<h4>Revisions</h4>
<p>Clauses M0000T and M0000C bearing the date "2005-06-10" are no longer on hold.  The "Remarks" for clauses M0000T and M0000C are revised to advise contracting officers to use these clauses in conjunction with a new clause M0100D, in lieu of clause K0000D.  Refer to Annex A below for revisions to the SACC Manual in bold and red text.  Refer to Annex B below for revisions to the Supply Manual in bold and red text.  These changes will be published in the next edition of the Manuals in December 2005.</p>
