<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Starting July 1, 2010, the provincial sales taxes in Ontario and British Columbia will be replaced by a value-added tax structure and combined with the federal Goods and Services Tax (<abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>) to create a single, federally administered Harmonized Sales Tax (<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>). The <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> will be applied on most supplies of property and services made in those provinces at a blended rate of 13% in Ontario (5% federal component and 8% provincial component) and 12% in British Columbia (5% federal component and 7% provincial component). With some exceptions, the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> will apply to the same base of property and services as the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>.</p>
<p>It is government policy that departments charge and collect, where applicable, the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> or the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> on their taxable supplies and pay <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> or <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> on their purchases, as required by legislation.</p>
<p>New place of supply rules that determine whether a supply is made in a province generally apply to taxable supplies made on or after May 1, 2010. These rules determine whether a supply is made in a participating province and consequently subject to the provincial component of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>. These new rules will not bring significant changes to the rules for tangible personal property and real property, however significant changes have been made to the place of supply rules for supplies of intangible personal property and services.</p>
<p>Nova  Scotia will increase the provincial component to 10% on July 1, 2010 which will mean that the blended rate of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> in that province will increase from 13% to 15%. The blended rate of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> in New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador is 13%.</p>
<p>In provinces with no <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>, the Government of Canada will continue to be exempt from paying provincial sales taxes on purchases of property and services in the name of Canada. Government contractors must continue to pay the provincial sales tax as it applies to supplies of property and services made in those provinces used or consumed in the performance of their contract.</p>
<h4>Transitional Rules</h4>
<p>Transitional rules have been designed to ensure that the current <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> and provincial retail tax systems do not overlap with the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>. They specify a number of key dates with respect to the timing for departments to account for the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>. The <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/gst-tps/gnrl/txbl/trnstnl/menu-eng.html" rel="external">transitional rules</a> apply to transactions that occur during a period that includes the implementation date of July 1, 2010.</p>
<p>Contracts that have been awarded prior to July 1, 2010 will not have to be amended as a result of the introduction of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> in Ontario and British  Columbia or the increase of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> in Nova Scotia; the determination of additional taxes on those existing contracts will be settled at payment. In the same way, contracts awarded prior to July 1, 2010 will not have to be re-approved as a result of the introduction of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> in Ontario and British  Columbia or the increase of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the payment of additional taxes as a result of the introduction of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> in Ontario and British Columbia or the increase of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> in Nova  Scotia on existing contracts should be directed to the person responsible to authorize payments as per Section 33 of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>.</p>
<h4>Place of Supply Rules</h4>
<p>The place of supply rules that determine whether a supply is made in Canada and potentially subject to <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> have not changed. These rules are explained in <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/gm/3-3/3-3-e.pdf" rel="external">Chapter 3.3 <em>Place of Supply</em> of the <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> Memoranda Series</a> and are not the subject of this policy notification</p>
<p>The place of supply rules that determine in which province a supply is made, thus determining what tax applies, have been changed. These rules determine whether, and at what rate, suppliers must charge the provincial component of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> on their taxable supplies (other than zero-rated supplies) of property and services that are made in Canada. Previously, many of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> place of supply rules for certain property and services relied on the location of the supplier to determine whether a supply is subject to the provincial component of the <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr>. The new <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> place of supply rules for intangible personal property and services have been changed so that, in determining where a supply takes place, there is less reliance on the supplier’s location and greater reliance on where the consumer of the intangible personal property or service is located.</p>
<p>The new place of supply rules are explained in the <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/gm/b-103/b-103-e.pdf" rel="external"><abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr>/<abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> Technical Information Bulletin B-103 (June 2010). </a> It should be noted that this bulletin is substantially different from the one that was circulated to Acquisitions Branch personnel via communiqué on 29 March 2010. Although no substantial changes are made to the place of supply rules for supplies of tangible personal property and real property, significant changes are made to the place of supply rules for supplies of intangible personal property and services.</p>
<p>These changes generally apply to supplies made on or after May 1, 2010. They may also apply to supplies made before May 1, 2010 if certain circumstances exist.</p>
<p>Here is a brief overview of the place of supply rules that will now apply to procurements:</p>
<h5>Tangible Personal Property (<abbr title="Tangible Personal Property">TPP</abbr>)</h5>
<p>Generally speaking, the place of supply rules for supplies of  <abbr title="Tangible Personal Property">TPP</abbr> by way of sale have not changed. A supply by way of sale of <abbr title="Tangible Personal Property">TPP</abbr> is deemed to be made in a province if the supplier delivers the property or makes it available in the province to the recipient of the supply.</p>
<p>The application of this place of supply rule is generally based on the province in which legal delivery of the goods to the recipient occurs. However, for purposes of the rule, tangible personal property is also deemed to be delivered in a particular province, and not in any other province, if the supplier either:</p>
<ul>
<li>ships the property to a destination in the particular province that is specified in the contract for carriage of the property or transfers possession of the property to a common carrier or consignee that the supplier has retained on behalf of the recipient to ship the property to such a destination; or</li>
<li> sends the property by mail or courier (the common meaning of “courier” applies for purposes of this rule) to an address in the particular province.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bulletin B-103 should be consulted for details.</p>
<h5>Real Property (<abbr title="Real Property">RP</abbr>)</h5>
<p>Generally speaking, the current place of supply rules for supplies of <abbr title="Real Property">RP</abbr> are not changing. A supply of <abbr title="Real Property">RP</abbr> is deemed to be made in the province where the property is situated. Bulletin B-103 should be consulted for details.</p>
<h5>Intangible Personal Property (<abbr title="Intangible Personal Property">IPP</abbr>)</h5>
<p>The place of supply rules for supplies of <abbr title="Intangible Personal Property">IPP</abbr> have changed significantly. Although the general rules will generally continue to be based in large part on where the <abbr title="Intangible Personal Property">IPP</abbr> can be used, the place of negotiation under the former rules will no longer be a factor and greater emphasis will be placed on the location of the recipient of the supply of the <abbr title="Intangible Personal Property">IPP</abbr>. As was the case under the former place of supply rules, there will be specific place of supply rules that apply with respect to specific types of supplies of <abbr title="Intangible Personal Property">IPP</abbr> such as <abbr title="Intangible Personal Property">IPP</abbr> that relates to <abbr title="Tangible Personal Property">TPP</abbr> or <abbr title="Intangible Personal Property">IPP</abbr> that relates to <abbr title="Real Property">RP</abbr>. Bulletin B-103 should be consulted for details.</p>
<h5>Services</h5>
<p>The place of supply rules for supplies of services have changed significantly. The new place of supply rules for supplies of services are generally based on the business address of the recipient obtained by the supplier in the ordinary course of business of the supplier except for certain types of services in respect of which specific place of supply rules apply.  A supply of a service that is in relation to <abbr title="Real Property">RP</abbr> or a service that is in relation to <abbr title="Tangible Personal Property">TPP</abbr> are examples of services for which there are specific place of supply rules. Bulletin B-103 should be consulted for details of these rules and the other types of services that have specific place of supply rules. In cases where a more specific rule does not apply, and in the ordinary course of business, the supplier obtains more than one business address in Canada of the recipient, the supply of the service is made in the province in which the business address that is the most connected with the supply is located.</p>
<p>For contracts awarded by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>’s Acquisitions Branch as a common service provider, it is the position of the Canada Revenue Agency (<abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>) that the business address that is most closely connected with the supply is the address of the contracting authority as it appears in the contract when first awarded. The address of the contracting authority, as it appears in the contract when first awarded, will determine the province in which the supply of the service is made.</p>
<p>As noted above different, specific, place of supply rules apply for the supply of services in relation to TPP or <abbr title="Real Property">RP</abbr> and for other specified services. Bulletin B-103 should be consulted for details.</p>
<h4>Client Requisitions</h4>
<p>Clients are responsible for submitting accurate requisitions and are accountable for the estimates on their requisitions. The requisition approval must be in accordance with the client department’s internal delegation of authority. Requisitions must be funded in Canadian currency, including the applicable taxes. In cases where the exact tax treatment of a supply is not known with certainty at the time of the requisition, clients shall include an amount for taxes representing a default tax rate of 15% of the value of the procurement in the requisition. Clients must be ready to demonstrate in writing the rationale for not including the default rate upon request by the contracting officer. Clients are reminded that the amount of taxes in their requisitions that exceeds the actual amount needed for taxes for the contract does not constitute an overcommitment to their departmental budget since taxes are paid from a statutory authority distinct from their appropriated budget.</p>
<h4 id="PN-94a11">Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions (<abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr>)</h4>
<p>Contracting officers are to incorporate the changes detailed in <a href="#PN-94a1">Annex A</a> (below) into their procurement documents. These changes will be reflected in the next <abbr title="Standard Acquisition Clauses and Conditions">SACC</abbr> Manual release scheduled for August 2010.</p>
<h5>General Considerations</h5>
<p>Every time an address is required in the procurement process, the address shall indicate a precise geographical location in a province. References to the National Capital Region (<abbr title="National Capital Region">NCR</abbr>) or a postal code are no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>Only the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> has authority to provide tax advice. Contracting officers are instructed to redirect any questions regarding <abbr title="Goods and Services Tax">GST</abbr> or <abbr title="Harmonized Sales Tax">HST</abbr> coming from outside Acquisitions Branch to the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>.</p>
<p>During the procurement process, contracting officers should obtain rulings directly from the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr>. The telephone numbers listed below should be used and Acquisitions Branch contracting officers should clearly identify themselves as such. In the event that the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agent is requesting that a draft contract be sent for ruling, first the contracting officer must make sure that the document bears the proper classification markings, then contracting officers may send the documentation using the Internal Credential Management (<abbr title="Internal Credential Management ">ICM</abbr>) system (myKEY) via e-mail. This system may be used for documents bearing the designation Protected “B” or below. Otherwise, contracting officers should follow the transmission methods outlined in the departmental Classification Guide. <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> agents receiving these draft contracts all have Secret security clearances. In the event where sending a draft contract could be problematic for security or other reasons, the contracting officer should contact the Acquisitions Branch Contact identified below.</p>
<p>The following address should be copied whenever correspondence is exchanged via e-mail between the <abbr title="Canada Revenue Agency">CRA</abbr> and Acquisitions Branch contracting officers: <a href="mailto:APPDpublications.DPPApublications@pwgsc-tpsgc.gc.ca" rel="external">APPDpublications.DPPApublications@pwgsc-tpsgc.gc.ca</a>.</p>
