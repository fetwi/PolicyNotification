<p>The Minister was sworn in as the Minister of Public Works and Government Services on July 12, 1996.</p>
<p>The name of our Department is now the Department of Public Works and Government Services, and the applicable legislation under which contracting activities are conducted is the <em>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</em>, S.C., 1996, c.16.</p>
<p>Contracts and solicitations issued before July 12, 1996 and containing reference to DSS or DPW were not invalidated when the Act came into force. Contract documents resulting from solicitations dated before July 12 may be issued with the new Departmental name. Such revision is not a substantive change to the solicitation. Amendments to contracts awarded before July 12, to reflect the new departmental name, are not necessary. Any solicitation or contract that may be issued using DSS or DPW is not rendered invalid by referring to the names of the former departments.</p>
<p>Supply Policy Directorate will, in the coming months, begin to change references to DSS in SACC clauses, as clauses come up for review and modification.</p>
<p>In the interim, the attached modified incorporation by reference clauses should be used (Annex A). These clauses will be released to the Automated Buyer Environment (ABE) and PASS systems with the next SACC release, which is expected October 30, 1996.</p>
<p>References to form numbers - e.g. DSS-MAS 9601, within the body of clauses, will not be changed, since these are the specific identifiers of the clauses in question. New clauses will refer to the new Department where applicable.</p>
<p>Additional questions may be directed to Tom Simper in Supply Policy Directorate at 819-956-0881.</p>
