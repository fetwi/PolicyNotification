<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification 72R2 (PN-72R2) is to notify Acquisitions Program (AP) contracting officers of changes to the processes involved in the creation, renewal and extension of Standing Offers (SOs) and Supply Arrangements (SAs), and the related roles and responsibilities of all associated stakeholders regarding posting information to the Standing Offer Index (SOI). The revisions to this <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr> will strengthen the Department’s management control framework for these procurement instruments.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this document, <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr>s include National Master Standing Offer (NMSO), National Individual Standing Offer (NISO), Regional Master Standing Offer (RMSO), Regional Individual Standing Offer (RISO) and Departmental Individual Standing Offer (DISO).</p>
<p>This <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr> must be read in conjunction with <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/policy-notifications/PN-92">Commodity Management Policy Notification PN-92</a>, which defines how National Goods and Services Procurement Strategies (NGSPS) will be developed. The latter  takes precedence over PN-72R2 should such a strategy exist for a category for which a <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr> and/or <abbr title="Supply Arrangement">SA</abbr> is being considered.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In July 2013, the Office of Audit and Evaluation (OAE) released a report (Audit of Standing Offers and Supply Arrangements: Creations, Renewals, and Extensions, 2011-712) on its examination of the Department’s management control framework for the creation, renewal, and extension of <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr>s and <abbr title="Supply Arrangement">SA</abbr>s. This report includes recommendations to strengthen this framework, mainly with respect to governance, process and controls. The Acquisitions Program is implementing a Management Action Plan that addresses these recommendations, an example of which is this <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>.</p>
<h2>Summary of Revisions to the Supply Manual</h2>
<p>This section identifies the mandatory steps for the creation, renewal or extension of <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr>s and <abbr title="Supply Arrangement">SA</abbr>s, posting information to the <abbr title="Standing Offer Index">SOI</abbr>, using standard Departmental procurement templates, as well as associated <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr> and <abbr title="Supply Arrangement">SA</abbr> reporting requirements.</p>
<p>The Office of Primary Interest (OPI) for specific goods or services is referred to as the Category Management Team and each team has a Category Reviewer responsible for endorsing the creation, extension or renewal of all <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr>s and <abbr title="Supply Arrangement">SA</abbr>s.</p>
<p>Should a required product or service not appear under a specific category, the contracting officer must seek endorsement of the <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr> or <abbr title="Supply Arrangement">SA</abbr> from the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervisor or Manager in the National Capital Area (NCA), or</li>
<li>Regional Category Reviewer outside the <abbr title="National Capital Area">NCA</abbr></li>

Contracting officers are encouraged to engage a Category Reviewer early in and throughout the procurement planning phase to obtain input, with a view to expediting the endorsement process. Should the Category Reviewer conditionally endorse or decline the request, it may be resubmitted upon its revision. Contracting officers must include the Category Reviewer’s final decision and evaluation documents in the Contract Planning and Advance Approval (CPAA) or Procurement Plan. Supporting rationale from the Category Reviewer must be included in the approval documentation, should the creation, renewal or extension of an existing <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr> or <abbr title="Supply Arrangement">SA</abbr> require the duplication an existing <abbr title="Standing Offer">SO</abbr> or <abbr title="Supply Arrangement">SA</abbr>.
