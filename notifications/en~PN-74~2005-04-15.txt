<h2>Annex A: Changes to the Supply Manual
</h2><p>					Annex 3.1: Division of Responsibilities Between <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> and DND for the Acquisition of Goods and Services
</p><p>3.1(i) This matrix is an assigned division of responsibility, agreed by<br/>
					the Ministers of the Department of National Defence (DND) and Public Works<br/>
					and Government Services Canada (<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>) .* It forms the foundation for an efficient<br/>
					and effective partnering relationship for those who are responsible for activities<br/>
					within the procurement process.</p>
<ul class="noBullet">
<li>* (a) The matrix does not represent delegation of procurement authority by the Minister of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, and does not affect the responsibility of the contracting officer as defined in Treasury Board (TB) Contracting Policy.
</li>
<li>(b) Legislation, regulations and policy will take precedence over this matrix in the case of any ambiguity.</li>
</ul>
<p> 3.1(ii) This matrix is to be used for all DND goods and services procured<br/>
					by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>. An "X" represents the assignment of each activity to a "Lead" and "Participatory" department. An "M" represents the norm for Major Crown Projects (MCPs) and MCP-like projects.</p>
<p>3.1(iii) The assignment of each activity to a "Lead" and "Participatory department" as indicated in this table is to be considered the normal way of doing business.  However, as every procurement and associated contract differs with respect to complexity, risk,value and availability of skilled resources, deviations can be agreed jointly in advance as long as justifications are formally filed in an agreement between the two Departments, which consider reasons why the norm cannot be applicable in specific areas.</p>
<p>3.1(iv) In all activities, it is incumbent upon each "Lead" to always consider as prudent, continuous communication with the procurement representatives of the other department, even if this "Lead" is identified as the sole "X". Finally, it is important to note that this matrix of assigned responsibilities is not necessarily sequential.</p>
<p>3.1(v) Effective communications between DND and <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> must be worked out on a project-by-project basis. The matrix below sets out anticipated DND internal responsibilities. For any individual project, DND requests that communications be through the procurement functional contact, the applicable DND Procurement Manager/Officer, unless otherwise discussed and agreed to with that procurement functional contact.</p>
