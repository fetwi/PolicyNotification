<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification (PN)-75R1 is to provide new direction to procurement personnel regarding contracts with task authorizations. The revised approach introduces new tools and  guidelines and includes changes to the <em>Supply Manual</em>(SM) and new clauses for the <em>Standard Acquisitions Clauses and  Conditions</em> (SACC) Manual.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In the last few years, several government audits have  taken place that included reviews of contracts with task authorizations. These reviews raised issues relative to the  application of financial controls, separation of duties, contract amendments, employer-employee relationships, and adherence to contractual conditions. The Acquisitions Branch has decided to update  its procedures to improve the effectiveness and consistency with which  contracts with task authorizations are used and managed.</p>
<h3>Effective Date</h3>
<p>This <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr> is effective immediately. However, for existing procurements where the Contract Planning and Advance Approval document  or Procurement Plan has already been submitted for approval, the implementation  of the new instructions within this <abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr> is at the contracting officer's  discretion, unless otherwise advised by management.</p>
<h3>Revisions to the current policy</h3>
<p>The following significant changes have been  made to the current policy on contracts with task authorizations:</p>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>Additional instructions are  provided to highlight the differences between contracts with task  authorizations, standing offers and supply arrangements. </li>
<li>Previous  information related to contracts with task authorizations is now organized more  closely to the order of the steps involved in the procurement process.</li>
<li>The <em>Supply Manual</em> will no longer state that Directors General have to maintain an  oversight of all contracting activity related to task authorizations within their sector/region.</li>
<li>Directors  now may approve or prohibit classes of procurement in which task authorizations  may be used.</li>
<li>There is no  longer a minimum approval authority for contracts with task authorizations at  the Director level. The approval  authority for contracts with task authorizations and for their modifications is  now in accordance with the approvals and authorities for contracts detailed in Chapter 6 of the <em>Supply Manual</em>.</li>
<li>Contracting officers who have been delegated services  contract approval and signing authority now have no maximum limit on the dollar amount for  authorizing individual task authorizations up to the total approved contract  value, unless directed otherwise by management.</li>
<li>The pertinent definitions in the Glossary have been revised.</li>
<li>Procedural guidance is now  provided for Public Works and Government Services Canada (<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s) clients  regarding contracts with task authorizations in the <em>Guide to Preparing and  Administering Task Authorizations – for <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s clients</em>.</li>
<li>A Record of Agreement template  is included to help in establishing the roles and responsibilities between the  contracting officers and the clients when contracts with task authorizations  are issued by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>. </li>
<li>A Task Authorization form <a href="http://publiservice-app.pwgsc.gc.ca/forms/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.details&amp;lang=e&amp;display=8891" rel="external"><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>-<abbr title="Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada">TPSGC</abbr> 572</a> <span> (accessible only on the Government of Canada network)</span> is provided for clients other than the Department of National  Defence (DND). The form <abbr title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr> 626 Task  Authorization will still be used in contracts for <abbr title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr>.</li>
<li>New and  revised SACC Manual clauses have been included.</li>
<li><abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>  applies the principle of separation of duties to task authorizations issued for  <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s own needs; i.e. the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> individual who signs the task authorization  must not also certify the associated invoices.  In its <em>Guide to Preparing and Administerin</em><em>g Task  Authorizations -</em> <em>for <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s Clients</em>,  <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> recommends this practice to all its clients. </li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#PN-75R1AnnexA">Annex A</a> contains all  the changes to the <em>Supply Manual</em>. The  previous procedures in 3.30, 3.35, 3.35.1, and Annex 3.4 have been replaced in  their entirety. Procedures 3.40, 3.45, 8.70.20 and two definitions of the Glossary have been revised. Procedure 6.25.40 has been deleted. </p>

<h4>Chapter 3 - Procurement Strategy</h4>
<p><strong>3.30	Methods of Supply</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) uses a variety  of approaches to meet procurement requirements.  This spectrum ranges from specific contracts which precisely define the  deliverables to be provided to a specific client by a specific date, to various  procurement instruments for use by a single or many departments and agencies,  for needs which are sometimes less well defined at the outset.</p>
<p>There are essentially three methods of  supply for procuring goods and services, which are:</p>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>contracts  (including contracts with task authorizations);</li>
<li>standing offers, and</li>
<li>supply arrangements.</li>
</ol>
<p>The contracting officer, in consultation with the client, chooses  the method of supply that best satisfies the client's requirements.</p>
<p>For additional information on when to use a contract (including contracts with task authorizations), a standing offer or a supply  arrangement, see <a href="#PN-75R1a3_35">3.35</a>, <a href="#PN-75R1a3_40">3.40</a> and <a href="#PN-75R1a3_45">3.45</a>. Contracting officers should also consult the comparison table in <a href="#PN-75R1Annex3_8">Annex 3.8</a> to assist them in determining which method of supply should be used when the precise nature, quantity and/or timing of  the need cannot be set out in advance. </p>
<p id="PN-75R1a3_35"><strong>3.35	Contracts</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>Contracts for goods, services and construction are generally used to  meet unique, well-defined requirements for a single client but they may also be  used to meet the requirements of more than one client. They are used where a standing offer or  supply arrangement is not warranted.</p>
<p>For more information on the required content of a contract, see Chapter 4.</p>
<p id="PN-75R1a3_35_1"><strong>3.35.1 Contracts with Task Authorizations</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.35.1.1	Definition</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>A contract with Task Authorizations (<abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s) is a method of supply for services under which all of the work or a portion of the work will be performed on an "as and when requested basis" through predetermined conditions including an administrative process involving task authorizations.  Contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are used in service contracting situations when there is a defined need by a client to rapidly have access to one or more categories of service(s) that are expected to be needed on a repetitive basis during the period of the contract.  Under contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the work to be carried out can be defined but the exact nature and timeframes of the required services, activities and deliverables will only be known as and when the service(s) will be required during the period of the contract.  The contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s must stipulate the conditions for issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s.  A <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is a structured administrative tool enabling <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> or a client to authorize work by a contractor on an "as and when requested" basis in accordance with the conditions of the contract.  <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are not individual contracts.</p>
<p id="PN-75R1a3_35_1_5"><strong>3.35.1.5	Application</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>Contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s may be used for service requirements such as:</p>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>Professional Services;</li>
<li>Informatics  Professional Services;</li>
<li>Technical  Investigation and Engineering Studies;</li>
<li>some  types of Repair and Overhaul (R&amp;O) services where work authorizations  issued are considered task authorizations, i.e. Additional Work Requirements (AWR); Mobile Repair Party (MRP); Special  Investigations and Technical Studies (SITS); Project Work Order (PWO).</li>
</ol>
<p>Contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are not to be used for shipbuilding or ship refits.  Nor are they to be used for those R&amp;O work authorizations that are not considered task authorizations, i.e. Selection Notice and Priority Summary (SNAPS); Repairable Materiel Request (RMR); Quartermaster Transfer Orders (QTO); and Vehicle Movement Orders (VMO).</p>
<p>Although <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are used for service requirements, they may be used to purchase incidental goods that are related to a specific service requirement when these goods will later become the property of the government.  When this incidental acquisition of goods will be necessary, the Contract Planning and Advanced Approval (CPAA) form or procurement plan (see 3.35.1.15) and the solicitation and resulting contract must address the conditions for this incidental acquisition of goods, with appropriate limitations defined.  <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s must not be used to have the contractor acquire goods on behalf of the client that are outside the scope of the work in order to circumvent the normal procurement process.  For instance, a contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s for engineering services cannot be used to purchase software unless this requirement was part of the original solicitation and the related payment provisions of the contract.</p>
<p>Directors may approve or prohibit classes of procurement in which <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s may be used.</p>
<p id="PN-75R1a3_35_1_10"><strong>3.35.1.10 Conditions of Use</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>Contracts with task authorizations that are improperly used can lead to major problems between the government and its suppliers, between <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and its clients, and for the government in the eyes of the public.  When a contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s is being considered as a method of supply for a particular procurement, before seeking approval for the procurement strategy, the contracting officer must follow all the applicable procedures detailed in <a href="#PN-75R1a3_35_1">3.35.1</a>  In instances when the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are issued only by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>, some of these procedures may not apply (i.e. roles and responsibilities, setting client limits for issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the guide for <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s clients, the Record of Agreement, some reporting requirements).</p>
<p>As conditions of use of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the contracting officer must:</p>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>ensure the  contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s is the appropriate method of supply for these services. (Refer to <a href="#PN-75R1a3_35_1_5">3.35.1.5</a> and <a href="#PN-75R1Annex3_8">Annex 3.8</a> attached, and other sections relative to methods of supply included in the Supply Manual).</li>
<li>decide  whether to allow the client to issue <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, and determine the financial limits  for issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s by clients. These  decisions should be made by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> in consultation with the client in accordance with 3.35.1.30.</li>
<li>provide the <em>Guide for Preparing and Administering Task Authorizations – for <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s Clients</em> (Appendix A to Annex 3.4) to the client with an explanation of its  purpose and discuss as required.</li>
<li>reach an  agreement with the client regarding the roles and responsibilities of both  organizations, including responsibilities for reporting. In this regard, the use of the <em>Record of  Agreement</em> template pertaining to the use of Task Authorizations (Appendix B  to Annex 3.4) is strongly encouraged. The agreement must include the provision for timely receipt of  documentation such as:<br/>
<ol class="double-space" type="A">
<li>copies of all <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s with their attachments;</li>
<li>copies of all revisions to <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s with their attachments;</li>
<li>copies of all claims/invoices, supported by reports.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>follow the  procedures detailed in <a href="#PN-75R1a3_35_1_15">3.35.1.15</a> to <a href="#PN-75R1a3_35_1_60">3.35.1.60</a>.</li>
<li>discuss, as required, the use  of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s with the client, in particular the administrative process for authorizing and issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s.</li>
</ol>
<p id="PN-75R1a3_35_1_15"><strong>3.35.1.15 Approval Documents for Contracts with Task Authorizations</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>For contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the Contract Planning and Advanced Approval (CPAA) form or procurement plan for a contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s must address the following, as applicable:</p>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>the reasons why the  services are deemed suitable for this method of supply.</li>
<li>the justification for the proposed financial limits for issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s by  clients.</li>
<li>a statement confirming that the <em>Guide for Preparing and Administering  Task Authorizations – for <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s Clients </em>was provided, and discussed with  the client, as required.</li>
<li>a statement confirming that an agreement was reached with the client  regarding roles and responsibilities of both organizations or a  statement confirming the client's commitment to reaching such an agreement  before issuance of the bid solicitation.</li>
<li>a statement confirming that discussions took place with the client on the  use of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, before the client authorizes the first task.</li>
<li>a description of the contract monitoring process and activities to be  implemented or carried out.</li>
</ol>

<p>The approval authority for contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, and for amendments which will amend the provisions of a contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, is in accordance with the approvals and authorities for contracts detailed in Chapter 6.</p>
<p id="PN-75R1a3_35_1_20"><strong>3.35.1.20 Bid Solicitations and Resulting Contract Documents</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>Contracting officers must ensure that the bid solicitation and resulting contract document(s) that they issue and use to establish the subsequent contract with task authorizations follows the standard approach for issuing solicitations (see Chapters 3 and 4).  For any portion of work to be performed on an "as and when requested" basis, the bid solicitation and the resulting contract document must include the following:</p>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>a clear Statement of Work (SOW) describing, in broad terms, the scope of work that will be performed pursuant  to issued <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s.</li>
<li>a description of the administrative process for authorizing  and issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s and the applicable SACC Manual clauses relative to <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s. In the case of multiple contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s,  the evaluation portion of the solicitation must include the contractors' order  of ranking process (generally as part of the basis of selection clause) and,  the resulting contract portion must include the contractors' order of ranking  and the work allocation process (to be completed at the time of contract  award). The following SACC Manual clauses relative to <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s must be used, as applicable: B9051C, B9053C, B9054C, B9056C, and C9011C.</li>
<li>the task authorization limits for authorizing and issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s by the client in accordance with the guidance in <a href="#PN-75R1a3_35_1_30">3.35.1.30</a></li>

<li>the payment provisions applicable to the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> such as basis or bases of payment (for example,  SACC Manual clause C0206C) and method(s) of payment.</li>
<li>Canada's obligation and Canada's total liability:<br/>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>all the work under a contract will be performed through <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s:
<ul>
<li>the SACC Manual clause B9030C must be used to limit Canada's obligation for <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s and to provide a minimum work guarantee to the Contractor; and, </li>
<li>the SACC Manual clause C9010C must be used when the contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s is subject to a Limitation of Expenditure to limit Canada's total liability under the contract for all approved <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s.  The "Total estimated cost" shown on the cover page of the contract document must equal the total of the limitation of expenditure stipulated under the clause.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when only a portion of the Work will be performed through task authorizations:
<ul>
<li>the SACC Manual clause B9031C must be used to limit Canada's obligation under the task authorizations; and, </li>
<li>the SACC Manual clause C6001C must be used when the contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s is subject to a Limitation of Expenditure to limit Canada's total liability under the contact.  The "Total estimated cost" shown on the cover page of the contract document must equal the total of the limitation of expenditure stipulated under the clause.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>  As contracting officers are responsible for monitoring the use of <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, they must also consider including a provision for reporting of usage of <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s by the contractor (i.e. SACC Manual clause <a href="#PN-75R1B9056C">B9056C</a>).

<p id="PN-75R1a3_35_1_30"><strong>3.35.1.30 Setting financial limits on Individual Task Authorizations</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>Task authorizations may be authorized and issued by the client and/or <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.  <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting officers who have been delegated services contract approval and signing authority have no maximum limit on the dollar amount for authorizing individual <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s up to the total approved contract value, unless directed otherwise by their management.  The decision to allow <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s to be issued by a client is made by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> in consultation with the client.  When the client will be allowed to authorize <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting officers must establish a maximum limit on the dollar amount of a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> (excluding Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)) authorized by the client.  In establishing such limits for individual <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s and any revisions to those <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, contracting officers should seek to achieve a balance between operational effectiveness and contract risk management, and should consider the following when setting the client's <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> limit:</p>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>whether  an agreement has been reached between the client and <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> on the conditions of  use of <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s. (See <a href="#PN-75R1a3_35_1_10">3.35.1.10</a>).</li>
<li>the client and the industry's  past performance history relative to the effective use of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s,  as experienced by the contracting officer and <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> colleagues/managers.
</li>
<li>the procurement/contract  management expertise that exists in the client department:<br/>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>Whether training is available/required.</li>
<li>Whether the client department policies and procedures are in place  and whether these are enforced. For  example, the internal procedure for the administration of <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s for the  Department of National Defence (DND) is contained in article 3.3.2 of <abbr title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr>'s <em>Procurement  Administration Manual</em> (PAM).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>operational requirements, e.g. time sensitivity of tasks.</li>
<li>contract scope and risk associated with individual tasks:<br/>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>The clarity and level of detail in the contract statement of work.</li>
<li>Anticipated complexity and duration of individual tasks.</li>
<li>Whether tasks can be easily priced.</li>
<li>The average value of <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the frequency of tasks and the number of tasks anticipated during the period of the contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>as applicable, the total estimated value of work that will be carried out through the portion of the work that is not performed through <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s in relation to the total estimated value of work that will be performed through <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s. </li>
<li>the frequency of reporting on task authorizations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, in setting the value at which <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> must authorize individual <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, contracting officers must ensure that this <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> involvement will add value to the task authorization process while at the same time ensuring that <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> maintains adequate control over the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> process.  Added value can be in several forms, such as financial oversight or comparisons with similar contracts for other clients to ensure value for money.  Setting the client's <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> limit should be subject to a department's experience in administering <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s and contracting officers may want to consider setting a limit such that <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> authorizes a representative amount of <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s.</p>
<p id="PN-75R1a3_35_1_35"><strong>3.35.1.35	Separation of Duties</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>The Treasury Board Directive on <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17060" rel="external">Directive on Delegation of Financial Authorities for Disbursements</a> requires that the authority to  enter into contract or amendment must be separate from the certification  authority required under section 34 of the <em>Financial  Administration Act</em>. In Chapter 3 of the <a href="http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_200812_03_e_31827.html" rel="external">2008 December Report of the Auditor General of Canada</a> , the Office of the  Auditor General raised  the issue of separation of duties  with respect to task authorizations and stated that combining procurement and  certification functions under the responsibility of one individual was not in  keeping with the Treasury Board Policy on Delegation. As a result, although task authorizations are  not individual contracts, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> applies the principle of separation of duties  to task authorizations issued for <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s own needs; i.e. the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> individual  who signs the task authorization must not also certify the associated invoices. In its <em>Guide to Preparing and  Administerin</em><em>g Task Authorizations -</em> <em>for <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s Clients</em>, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> recommends this practice to all its clients. However, as specified in the above-mentioned  <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> Directive, where the client's current processes in place or other  circumstances do not allow such separation of duties, alternate control  measures may be implemented by the client.  The client is responsible to ensure that its current processes or  alternate control measures can withstand scrutiny under audit.</p>
<p><strong>3.35.1.40	Authorizing and Issuing Task Authorizations</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>The client organization authorized to issue tasks to the contractor is responsible for authorizing and issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s in accordance with the process detailed in the contract.  As a minimum, the client organization is responsible for: </p>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>ensuring the work requirement of the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> including the deliverables and the schedule, as applicable, is in accordance with the scope of the contract.</li>
<li>providing the contractor with the task description, the payment provisions and obtaining the level of effort, as applicable.
<p>Setting dates or timeframes for completing tasks must take into consideration the expiry date of the contract.  A task must be completed on or before the expiry date of the contract, however, if a task cannot be completed by such date, a contract amendment to extend the contract period to the task completion date must be issued by the contracting officer before the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> can be issued.</p>
</li>
<li>finalizing the task authorization, including the total value of the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> (GST/HST extra), in accordance with the contract.</li>
<li>obtaining all applicable signatures (client, or <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>, or both, as applicable; and contractor), and the date of these signatures on the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>. </li>

<p><strong>3.35.1.50	Revision of a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> by the Client</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>The client may revise a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> that it originally authorized subject to the work being within the scope and value of the contract as well as within the client authority limit set in the contract.  Any revision to the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is subject to concurrence by the contractor.  A <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> revision, which will bring the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> value above the client <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> limit, must be referred to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>An authorized <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> may be revised to either reduce an activity (or activities) or to cancel the task in its entirety, however a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> cannot be terminated for default or for convenience.  In situations when the contractor is in default or for the convenience of Canada, the termination provisions of the applicable general conditions will apply and the contract may be terminated either entirely or in part for default or for convenience.  Such matters must be referred to the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting officer.</p>
<p><strong>3.35.1.55	Monitoring and Oversight</strong><br/>
		(2011-01-11)</p>
<p>Contracting officers must monitor issued <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s to ensure they comply with the contract conditions.  They must also review progress reports to ensure the work is being performed in accordance with the contract and the issued <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s and to monitor the amount expended against the contract value.</p>
<p>If the monitoring of the authorized and issued <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s demonstrates that the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> process is not in accordance with the contract or the agreement with the client, the specific corrective measures must be implemented.  This is addressed in the Record of Agreement template at Appendix B to Annex 3.4, paragraph 5.  The contracting officer must notify the contractor when the limit of the client's authority specified in the contract is reduced or revoked.  Furthermore, invoking penalty or termination provisions should not be undertaken without consultation with Legal services.</p>

<h4 id="PN-75R1aappendixA">Appendix A (to Annex 3.4):	A Guide to Preparing and Administering Task Authorizations - for <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s Clients<br/>
(2011-01-11) </h4>
<p><strong>1.0	Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the<em> Guide to Preparing  and Administering Task Authorizations</em> is to provide procedural guidance to  Public Works and Government Services Canada's (<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s) clients when contracts  for services containing task authorizations are issued by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and the client  is authorized to issue individual task authorizations (<abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s). This guide incorporates advice on preparing  and administering <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s. Many of the  principles discussed in this document equally apply to other mechanisms by which  goods or services are ordered under a contract on an “as and when requested”  basis such as a service order. For the  Department of National Defence (DND) requirements, this guide supplements the  internal procedure for administering <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s documented in article 3.3.2 of <abbr title="Department of National Defence">DND</abbr>'s <em>Procurement  Administration Manual</em> (PAM).</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Definitions</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1	Contracts with Task Authorizations</strong></p>
<p>A contract with Task Authorizations (<abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s) is a method of supply for services under which all of the work or a portion of the work will be performed on an "as and when requested basis" through predetermined conditions including an administrative process involving task authorizations.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Task Authorization</strong></p>
<p>A <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is a structured administrative tool enabling <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> or a client, or both to authorize work, by a contractor on an "as and when requested" basis in accordance with the conditions of the contract.</p>
<p><strong>3.	Application of Contracts with Task Authorizations</strong></p>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>A contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s may be used when there is a definite need for services but the exact nature, the timeframes of the required services, activities and deliverables will only be known when the service(s) will be required during the period of the contract.  <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> determines when the client's needs would be best addressed by the use of a contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s.  If the client is authorized to issue <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the limit of this approval would be stipulated in the contract.  All <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s in excess of this limit have to be forwarded to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> for authorization.  A contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s can be set up to cover multiple years.  This approach can eliminate the need to establish a new contract every year.  Multiple contracts with task authorizations may be issued in certain circumstances when one contract would not be sufficient to fulfill all requirements.  In such cases, the contractors' order of ranking, the specific work allocation process, Canada's total liability for all issued <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s and the authorization limit would be identified in the contracts.</li>
<li>Some examples of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are as follows:<br/>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>a requirement for translation where the work is generally defined and the specific tasks for translation (e.g. a required translation of 50,000 words) are on an as and when requested basis;</li>
<li>a requirement for maintenance of equipment where the general maintenance work is defined in the contract and, when the equipment failure/issue occurs, the specific maintenance task is authorized on an as and when requested basis;</li>
<li>a requirement for an informatics technology specialist over a defined period, but the specific activities and deliverables cannot be identified in advance nor the timing or level of effort predicted.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An advantage of using contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s is the mitigation of contractual risks as a result of better-defined tasks, the establishment of a level of effort on a per task basis and more precise pricing for each specific task thereby ensuring better management of the contract.</li>
<li>When they are properly used, contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s provide a structured framework offering operational speed and flexibility to clients.  Contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s will be successful provided that there is a clear understanding and agreement between <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and the client as to their respective roles and responsibilities relating to the management of the contract including for authorizing and issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s and task authorization management..  The improper use of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s can lead to major problems between the government and its suppliers, between <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and its clients, and for the government in the eyes of the public.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4.	Conditions of Use</strong></p>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>As a condition of use of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting officer will, as a minimum:<br/>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>ensure the contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s is the appropriate method of supply for these required services in consultation with the client.</li>
<li>decide whether the client will be allowed to authorize and issue <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, and determine the financial limit of this authority.  These decisions will be made in consultation with the client and the associated provisions will be detailed in the contract.  All <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s in excess of the determined limit must be forwarded to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> for authorization and issuance.</li>
<li>consult with the client to reach an agreement on the roles and responsibilities of both organizations including the client's responsibilities for reporting. </li>
<li>discuss, as required, the use of contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s with the client and in particular the administration of <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5.	Task Authorization Process and Administration </strong></p>
<p>The client authorized to issue tasks to the contractor is responsible for issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s in accordance with the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> process and administration of the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> detailed in the contract.  If the task does not seem to be within the scope of the work, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> must be consulted before any <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is contemplated. </p>
<p>The responsibilities of the client are detailed below:</p>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li><abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> Statement of Work (SOW) or task description<br/>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>ensure the task (or revised task) description of the work required (activities to be performed, deliverables to be submitted, completion dates for major activities or submission dates for deliverables or, as applicable, both) included in the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is in accordance with the contract Statement of Work (SoW).  This includes:<br/>
<ul class="double-space">
<li>ensuring that the text of the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> does not have the potential to create employer-employee relationships. See the Canada Revenue Agency publication <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/rc4110/" rel="external">RC 4110 - Employee or  Self-Employed?</a>; and </li>
<li>Setting dates or timeframes for completing tasks taking into consideration the expiry date of the contract.  A task must be completed on or before the expiry date of the contract; however, if a task cannot be completed by such date, a contract amendment to extend the contract period to the task completion date would have to be issued by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> before the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> can be authorized and issued.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>provide to the contractor the task or description of the work , the schedule, the quantity, and the associated payment provisions, all in accordance with the conditions of the contract.</li>
<li>facilitate knowledge transfer at the end of the work to reduce reliance on the same consultant or contractor. </li>
<li>consult with the contractor and the contracting officer, as applicable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Task Authorization Stage<br/>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>the response from the contractor must be reviewed by the client to ensure conformity with the conditions and payment provisions stipulated in the contract and its amendments, e.g. predetermined categories of resources and rates or pricing stipulated in the contract and its amendments are used by the contractor to quote on the level of effort for the specific task.</li>
<li>if resources are named in the contract (i.e. specific individuals are identified for specific contract categories), replacement must be in accordance with the conditions of the contract or subsequent amendments and meet the criteria used in the selection of the individual.  However, for contracts that do not contain named resources, then the client should complete and retain on file an evaluation of such new named resource.  The evaluation must completely assess such resource ensuring he/she meets all qualifications as stipulated in the contract or its amendments.</li>
<li>before authorizing a task, the client must ensure that:<br/>
<ul class="double-space">
<li>the task is within the client's authority limit; if the value of the task exceeds the client authorization limit contained in the contract and contract amendments, the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> must be forwarded to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> for authorization.</li>
<li>the task can be completed on or before the expiry date of the contract, and,</li>
<li>the authorization of the task will not result in the cumulative value of all task authorizations to exceed the limitation of expenditure for all <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is finalized, including the total value of the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> task, in accordance with the conditions of the contract, and the client and/or <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> authorizes the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> by signing and dating the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>.</li>
<li>the contractor signs and dates the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> authorized by the client and/or <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and provides the signed original with their attachments and a copy as detailed in the contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Start of the work for a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>
<p>Work on a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> cannot commence until a contract allowing task authorizations has been awarded and the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> has been authorized and issued in accordance with the conditions of the contract.  Contracts must never be awarded and <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s must never be authorized retroactively.  The <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> form must be authorized by the client and/or, if required, by <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and signed by the contractor before the work starts.</p>
</li>
<li>Task Authorization Management<br/>
<ol class="double-space" type="i">
<li>before the contract is issued or the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> process implemented, the client must inform <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> when personnel other than the project or technical authority are involved in the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> process.  The client must also confirm that appropriate training on the use of <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s has been provided to such personnel.</li>
<li> the client must notify the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority when the client authority named in the contract is to be replaced so that the contract can be amended.</li>
<li> the client must create and update a record of all tasks authorized under a contract and provide such a record to <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> as agreed between the two organizations.</li>
<li> the client must monitor task performance, work delivered, conduct proper cost review and provide reports to the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority as agreed between both organizations.</li>
<li>the client must have specific processes in place to ensure that billing rates and categories of resources or other payment provisions included in authorized and issued <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are in accordance with the conditions of the contract.</li>
<li> the client must provide complete and timely reporting of performance or arising issues under a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> to the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority.</li>
<li> the client must ensure that the dollar value does not exceed the individual <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> financial/dollar limit(s) specified in the contract with task authorizations or any limit placed on the cumulative value of <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s under the contract.</li>
<li> before authorizing payment of an invoice in accordance with departmental procedures for an authorized and issued <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> , the client must ensure that:<br/>
<ul class="double-space">
<li>the timesheets are in accordance with the contract, where applicable;</li>
<li>the services have been performed, received and accepted; if applicable, an individual who has direct knowledge of the level of effort reported must verify the level of effort reported on the timesheet for the contractor resource; </li>
<li>the invoice is consistent with the conditions and payment provisions stipulated in the contract or subsequent amendments and all required substantiating documentation is completed, approved and on file. See paragraph 7 below relative to separation of duties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6.	Revising a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> authorized by the client</strong></p>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>The client may revise a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> that it originally authorized subject to the work being within the scope and value of the contract as well as within the client authority limit set in the contract.  Any revision to the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is subject to concurrence by the contractor. A <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> revision, which will bring the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> value above the client <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> limit, must be referred to the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting officer.
</li>
<li>An authorized <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> may be revised to either reduce an activity (or activities) or to cancel the task in its entirety, however a <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> cannot be terminated for default or for convenience.  In situations when the contractor is in default or for the convenience of Canada, the termination provisions of the applicable general conditions will apply and the contract may be terminated either entirely or in part for default or for convenience.  Such matters must be referred to the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Contracting Authority.  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7.	Separation of duties</strong></p>
<p>The Treasury Board (TB) <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=17060" rel="external">Directive on Delegation of Financial Authorities for Disbursements</a> requires that the  authority to enter into contract or amendment must be separate from the  certification authority under section 34 of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>.  In Chapter 3 of the <a href="http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_200812_03_e_31827.html" rel="external">2008 December Report of the Auditor General of Canada</a>, the Office of the Auditor  General raised issues  relative to the application of  separation of duties with respect to task authorizations and stated that  combining procurement and certification functions under the responsibility of  one individual was not in keeping with the <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> Policy on Delegation. As a result, although task authorizations are  not individual contracts, <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> applies the principle of separation of duties  to task authorizations issued for <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>'s own needs; i.e. the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> individual  who signs the task authorization must not also certify the associated invoices. <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> recommends this  practice to all its clients. However, as specified in the above-mentioned <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr>  Directive, where the client's current  processes in place or other circumstances do not allow such separation of  duties, the client may implement alternate control measures. The client is responsible to ensure that its  current processes or alternate control measures can withstand scrutiny under  audit.</p>
<p><strong>8.	Corrective measures</strong></p>
<p>The <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Contracting Authority may take corrective measures such as reducing or revoking the client's authority to issue <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s where there are indications that the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> process is not working in accordance with the contract and the agreement between the client and <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr>.</p>
<p><strong>9.	Tips</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.1 Method of Supply Planning</strong></p>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>Do not request that <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> establish more labour categories and contracts than are necessary.
</li>
<li>Do not add new contract categories to engage specific individuals.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>9.2	Employer-Employee Relationships:</strong></p>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>Avoid using employment-type language in describing the work such as specifying the number of hours of work per day/week or the manner in which the work is to be conducted. </li>
<li>Avoid long-term assignments or a continuing relationship where a steady income stream from the department or agency is involved; state clearly the start and completion dates and ensure the contractor sets his or her hours of work.</li>
<li>Avoid controlling how the contractor carries out the work; work and results should only be overseen by the project/technical authority.</li>
<li>Avoid having the contractor work on government premises.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>9.3	Administration of Task Authorizations</strong></p>
<ol class="double-space" type="a">
<li>Do not split a requirement to get around the client authority limit stipulated in the contract.</li>
<li>Avoid task descriptions for <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s that could create a conflict of interest.</li>
<li>Ensure the price is fair and reasonable for the specific task and in accordance with the basis of payment in the contract.</li>
<li>Ensure there are sufficient funds.</li>

<p>The purpose of this document is to  formalize a Record of Agreement between <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> and the Authorized Client  regarding their respective roles and responsibilities when using the contract with task authorizations identified above (refer to the  “Matrix of Roles and Responsibilities” attached hereto). It is imperative that the Authorized Client  and the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority work closely together at all times during  the period of the contract.</p>
<p><strong>2. Period of the Agreement</strong></p>
<p>The conditions of this Record of Agreement  will be in effect for the entire duration of the contract.</p>
<p><strong>3. Task Authorization </strong></p>
<p>As specified in the contract (once  awarded), the Authorized Client's designated authority may authorize individual  task authorizations up to a limit of $ ______ (<em>insert amount</em>), Goods  and Services Tax (GST) or Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) extra, inclusive of any  revisions to the authorized <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s. Any <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>  in excess of that limit or any revisions to the authorized <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> that would  increase the <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> total value above that limit must be authorized by ________ (<em>insert, as  applicable,</em> “the Authorized Client designated authority and  the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Contracting Authority"<em> or</em> "the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> Contracting Authority") before issuance.</p>
<p><strong>4. Contract Amendment Process</strong></p>
<p>The Authorized Client understands that it  must not request the contractor to perform any work in excess of or outside the  scope of the contract and it must not issue <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s where the cumulative value of  all <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s would exceed the contract value.  Any anticipated changes to the contract must be authorized, in writing,  by the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority through the issuance of a contract amendment  before any additional work or <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is authorized. <strong>At any time during the contract  period, when there is a need to amend the contract, the Authorized Client must </strong>inform  the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority accordingly, in writing (e-mail), and provide  him/her the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>a  clear and accurate rationale for amending the contract; e.g. the  reason why the work cannot be completed by the contract expiry date, why there  is a shortfall of funds, etc.;</li>
<li>the cumulative value of all <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s (GST or HST extra) issued to date;</li>
<li>the total contract expenditures (GST or HST extra) to date;</li>
<li>the estimated price breakdown for any additional work required;</li>
<li>the consequences of not amending;</li>
<li>justification for  the required amendment versus initiating a new procurement; and</li>
<li>the status of the  replacement procurement in the case of on-going work.</li>
</ol>
<p>If <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> determines that the contract will  not be amended, the Authorized Client will be advised accordingly. If the contract can be amended, the  Authorized Client will then forward to the <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority a duly  signed requisition amendment (PWGSC-TPSGC 9200).</p>
<p><strong>5. Contract Management – Corrective  Measures</strong></p>
<p>If there are indications that the  Authorized Client is not complying with the conditions of this agreement, the  <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> contracting authority will discuss the matter with the Authorized  Client's designated representative, the contractor or both and take any of the  following corrective measures, deemed appropriate:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>change the detail and/or frequency of the information reporting;</li>
<li>discuss with the Authorized Client's staff responsible for issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, or with the contractor if needed;</li>
<li>reduce any dollar limit that might have been placed on individual <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s and/or suspend or cancel the Authorized Client's authority limit for <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> authorization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both parties agree to comply with the conditions of this Record of Agreement.  Further, it is understood and agreed that this agreement may be amended from time to time, as necessary.  Except for any change resulting from a corrective measure specified in 5 (a) to (c) above, amendments will not be implemented until an amended Record of Agreement has been formalized and accepted via e-mail by both parties. </p>

<td headers="un_7 un_8"><strong>Determining the Method to Use</strong></td>
<td headers="un_7 un_9">A contract with Task  Authorizations (<abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s) is a method of supply for services under which all of the  work or a portion of the work will be performed on an "as and when requested"  basis through predetermined conditions including an administrative process  involving task authorizations. Contracts  with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are used in service contracting situations when there is a defined  need by a client to rapidly have access to one or more category of service(s)  that are expected to be needed on a repetitive basis during the period of the  contract. Under contracts with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s, the  work to be carried out can be defined but the exact nature and timeframes of  the required services, activities and deliverables will only be known as and  when the service(s) will be required during the period of the contract. The contract with <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s must stipulate the  conditions for issuing <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s. A <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr> is a structured administrative tool enabling  <abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> or a client to authorize work by a contractor on an “as and when  requested” basis in accordance with the conditions of the contract. <abbr title="Task Authorization">TA</abbr>s are not individual contracts.</td>
<td headers="un_7 un_10">The  standing offer method of supply is used when it is possible to clearly define the requirement but expected  quantities (level of effort) and timing are not known. It is used when the client/<abbr title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</abbr> is unwilling or unable to  offer a minimum work guarantee, or wants to maintain multiple sources of  supply. It is used to satisfy the  requirements of departments and agencies for commonly ordered, commercially  available goods, services or both, by arranging with suppliers to submit  standing offers to provide goods, services or both, during a specified  period. A call-up against a standing  offer is a contract.</td>
<td headers="un_7 un_11">This  method of supply is used to establish a pool of suppliers when there is a  recurring need for a certain type of good or service, but a standing offer is  not suitable due to the inability to fully define the requirement in advance,  and there is a desire to compete the requirement. The supply arrangement (SA) establishes a framework that permits  expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations which result in  contracts.</td>
