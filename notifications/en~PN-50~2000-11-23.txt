<p>Further to a recent review of the Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity (FCP-EE) policy, it has been decided to implement the following change in the requirement concerning Certifications of Commitment or Certification numbers.</p>
<p>Bidders will continue to be asked whether the Program applies to them or not, and in the affirmative, they will be required to provide a Certification of Commitment, or their valid Certification number in the case where they have certified their commitment previously.</p>
<p>However, it will no longer be mandatory that this information be provided by bid closing. Contracting officers will be responsible for ensuring compliance of the proposed contractor with the FCP EE requirement <strong>prior to contract award</strong>.</p>
<p>A revised SACC K2000T is provided in Annex A, and revised SM procedures (5.112 and 7D.364) are provided in Annex B.</p>

<h2>ANNEX A - SACC MANUAL CLAUSE</h2>
<p>(See Supply Manual procedure 5.113 for exclusions from the FCP EE)</p>
<p><strong>K2000T (xx/xx/xx) Employment Equity</strong></p>
<p>1. The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity requires that Canadian organizations bidding for federal government contracts, $200,000.00 and over, make a formal commitment to implement employment equity, as a pre-condition to the validation of their bids. If the bidder is subject to the Program, evidence of its commitment must be provided prior to the award of any contract.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The program requirements do not apply to organizations which:<br/>
						(  ) have fewer than 100 permanent part-time and/or full time employees across Canada or;<br/>
						(  ) are a federally regulated employer.<br/>
						(<em>Please check the appropriate item above if applicable</em>)</li>
<li>If the bidder's organization does not fall within the parameters of items above, the program requirements do apply and, as such the bidder is required to submit a duly signed Certificate of Commitment as referenced below, or its Certificate number _______ confirming its adherence to the program.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. In all cases, the bidder is required to produce evidence of supporting information on demand, if such evidence is not provided with its bid. Under no circumstance will a contract be awarded to an organization that does not comply with the requirements of the Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity, unless it is exempt from the Program.</p>
<h3>NOTE:</h3>
<p>1. The Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity applies to Canadian-based bidders only.</p>
<p>2.

<h3>CHAPTER 5 - SOURCING STRATEGY</h3>
<p><strong>Employment Equity</strong></p>
<p>5.112 (xx/xx/xx) The eligibility of suppliers to bid on procurement opportunities may be limited by the Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity. Contracts for requirements for goods and services valued at $200,000 or more must be awarded to vendors who:</p>

<li>choose to comply with the employment equity requirements by sending the Certificate of Commitment or providing the certification number, <strong>prior to contract award</strong>; or</li>
<li>are exempted from the employment equity policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the bid is accompanied by an original certificate, the contracting officer will forward that original to the:</p>
<ul class="noBullet">
<li>Chief, Federal Contractors Program</li>
<li>Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC)</li>

<h2>CHAPTER 7 - BID HANDLING</h2>
<p><strong>Employment Equity</strong></p>
<p>7D.364 (xx/xx/xx) A recommended bid from a supplier subject to the Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity cannot proceed to award unless a signed Certificate of Commitment or Certificate number is provided.</p>
<p>The Certificate of Commitment or Certificate number is a pre-condition to the validation of bids rather than a condition of the contract.</p>
<p>The contracting officer is to treat any bid, regardless of value, from a supplier under sanction for non-compliance with the Employment Equity policy as non-responsive.</p>
