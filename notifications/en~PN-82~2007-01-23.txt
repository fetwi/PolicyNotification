<div>
<h4><em>Client Review of Elements of a Bid Solicitation</em></h4>
<p><em>7A.150 (xxxx-xx-xx) For sensitive or high-risk procurements, where<br/>
						the client department has primary responsibility for the requirement<br/>
						definition and/or evaluation of technical proposals, before issuing<br/>
						the bid solicitation, the contracting officer must clearly explain to<br/>
						the client their responsibilities with respect to the bid solicitation<br/>
						and obtain written confirmation from the client of the following:</em></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><em>that the Statement of Work, Statement of Requirement and/or the<br/>
							technical specifications which will be included in the bid solicitation<br/>
							accurately represent their requirements; and</em></li>
<li><em>that they concur with the bid evaluation criteria and contractor<br/>
							selection methodology detailed in the bid solicitation (including any<br/>
							percentages with respect to the technical evaluation vs. the price<br/>
							evaluation).</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Contracting officers should direct their clients to Annex 3.1, Annex 3.3, Annex 3.4 or Annex 3.5, as appropriate. The contracting officer must keep a record of all consultations with the client regarding requirements definition<br/>
						and technical evaluation. (See 6B.142 - 6B.151 for more information<br/>
						on bid evaluation criteria).</em></p>
<p><em>It is the client department's responsibility to determine the required<br/>
						level of authority of the personnel authorized to provide the client<br/>
						confirmation detailed above.</em></p>
