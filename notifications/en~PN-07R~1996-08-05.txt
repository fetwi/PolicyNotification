<p>At the request of Industrial and Commercial Products and Standardization Services Sector (ICPSSS), this Notification replaces # 7 with additional information.</p>
<p>Legal counsel at Industry Canada has concluded that procurements which are subject to Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements (CLCAs) can also be subject to the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT). Based on Article 1802 of the <acronym title="Agreement on Internal Trade">AIT</acronym>, Industry Canada considers that the notification and other requirements in the <acronym title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements">CLCA</acronym>s are "measures", as defined in Chapter 2 of the <acronym title="Agreement on Internal Trade">AIT</acronym>, and, that, to the extent they are "severable" from the procurement as a whole, are excluded from the obligations of the <acronym title="Agreement on Internal Trade">AIT</acronym>, but the procurement itself and all other aspects of it remain covered.</p>
<p>This means that provisions contained in the <acronym title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements">CLCA</acronym>s, such as notification procedures or evaluation criteria favouring complainant groups, must be complied with despite the fact that they may appear to be inconsistent with corresponding provisions in the <acronym title="Agreement on Internal Trade">AIT</acronym>. For example, if a <acronym title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements">CLCA</acronym> includes a provision that procurement opportunities must be advertised in specific newspaper(s), then the Crown must so advertise, in addition to complying with the advertising procedures set out in Chapter 5 of the <acronym title="Agreement on Internal Trade">AIT</acronym>. It would be appropriate in these procurements to explain on the file the course of action taken, with a reference to the corresponding provisions in the <acronym title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements">CLCA</acronym>(s) and the <acronym title="Agreement on Internal Trade">AIT</acronym>.</p>
<p>The above approach applies when a procurement is subject to only <acronym title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements">CLCA</acronym>s and the <acronym title="Agreement on Internal Trade">AIT</acronym>. The integrated approach, in which the most open procedures, e.g. the longer of two bidding periods, continues to apply for procurements subject to overlapping trade agreement coverage, such as when the <acronym title="Agreement on Internal Trade">AIT</acronym> and <acronym title="North American Free Trade Agreement">NAFTA</acronym> both apply.</p>
<p>The Supply Manual will be revised to reflect this change.</p>
<p>The Automated Buyer Environment (ABE) has been modified to include the option of identifying a procurement as subject to both <acronym title="Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements">CLCA</acronym>s and the <acronym title="Agreement on Internal Trade">AIT</acronym>.</p>
