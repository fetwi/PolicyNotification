<h3>ANNEX B</h3>
<h4>CHANGES TO THE SUPPLY MANUAL</h4>
<h4>Year 2000 Warranty</h4>
<p>6.332 (__/__/98) For procurements of goods or services which must perform date related processing prior to, during or after the Year 2000, Contracting Officers shall include one or more of the following appropriate SACC Manual clauses in bid solicitations, contracts and standing offers:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>SACC Manual clause K0039D for specific goods such as hardware, software or firmware;</li>
<li>SACC Manual clause K0040D for facility management or outsourcing services;</li>
<li>SACC Manual clause K0041D for system integration services;</li>

<li>SACC Manual clause K0043D for goods not directly related to Information Technology (IT) procurements; and</li>
<li>SACC Manual clause K0044D for services not directly related to IT procurements.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of sole source or no substitute contracts or standing offers which include multiple products, where the vendor declares that the Year 2000 Warranty does not apply to certain products, then the contracting officer shall designate these products in the contract or standing offer.</p>
<p>In the case of a competitive process the Year 2000 Warranty clause(s) shall be included as a mandatory clause in the solicitation document.</p>
<p>To prevent confusion regarding contractors' obligations with respect to the approved Year 2000 Warranty clauses, the following practices must be followed where, in sole source or no substitute situations, the Contracting Officer negotiates any modifications to the Year 2000 Warranty clause(s): the modified clause shall be reviewed by Legal Services; accepted by the requisitioning department in writing as indicated below; and, the clause title shall not include the words "Year 2000 Warranty".</p>
<p>Where a client requests that the Year 2000 Warranty clause(s) not be incorporated into its procurement (for example, where the product, application or related services will not be used to perform date related processing), procurement staff are to comply with this request provided that the Director General of Informatics or departmental equivalent of the requisitioning department provided written instructions to this effect.</p>
