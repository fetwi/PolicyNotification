<h4>2.3 International Sanctions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Persons in Canada, and Canadians outside of Canada,<br/>
						are bound by economic sanctions imposed by Canada. As a result,<br/>
						the Government of Canada cannot accept delivery of goods or services<br/>
						that originate, either directly or indirectly, from the countries<br/>
						or persons subject to economic sanctions. <br/>
						Details on existing sanctions can be found at: <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/sanctions/index.aspx?lang=eng" rel="external">http://www.international.gc.ca/sanctions/index.aspx?lang=eng</a>.</li>

						of Canada any goods or services which are subject to economic<br/>
						sanctions.</li>
<li>By law, the Contractor must comply with changes to<br/>
						the regulations imposed during the life of the Contract. During<br/>
						the performance of the Contract, should the imposition of sanctions<br/>
						against a country or person or the addition of a good or service<br/>
						to the list of sanctioned goods or services cause an impossibility<br/>
						of performance for the Contractor, the situation will be treated<br/>
						by the Parties as a force majeure. The Contractor must immediately<br/>
						inform Canada of the situation and the procedures applicable<br/>
						to force majeure will then apply.</li>
