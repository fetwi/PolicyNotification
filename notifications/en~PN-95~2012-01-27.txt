<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification (PN) 95 is to announce a change to the Formal Procurement Plan process. Most Formal Procurement Plans will now be approved at the director general/regional director general (DG/RDG) level instead of at the level of the Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM), Acquisitions Branch. This change simplifies the approval process and supports an effective and efficient procurement process.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> will continue to approve procurement plans for non-competitive procurements (including non-competitive procurements where an advance contract award notice is used). The <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> is to be notified of sensitive procurements once they are approved by the <abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Director General">RDG</abbr> by way of a copy of the signed procurement plan.</p>
<p>To assist in the preparation of a procurement plan and in order to standardize the procurement plan approach, a proposed template is attached. The <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/app-acq/arp-pns/ap95-pn95-frm-eng.html" rel="external">template</a> captures the required elements of a procurement plan and can be used in conjunction with Supply Manual Annex 6.1 Procurement Plan Instructions.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Formal Procurement Plan is required for the approval of the procurement strategy. Currently, for all procurements where the value is estimated to exceed the <abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Director General">RDG</abbr> contract approval limits, the procurement plan is prepared for the signature of the <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> who has full authority to approve procurement plans.</p>
<p>The process for procurements will now change to allow the <abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Director General">RDG</abbr> to approve most procurement plans for procurements exceeding their contract approval limits with the exception of non-competitive procurements (including non-competitive procurements where an advance contract award notice is used). The change of approval from the <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> to the <abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Director General">RDG</abbr> will not affect the current processes for approvals at the <abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Director General">RDG</abbr> level and below.</p>
<p>There is no change to the Contract Request process for procurements. Contract Requests to enter into a contract will continue to be prepared for the <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> for requirements requiring <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> approval authority.</p>
<h3>Effective Date</h3>
<p>This <abbr title="Policy Notification ">PN</abbr> is effective immediately.</p>
<h3>Revisions to the current policy</h3>
<p>The following is a synopsis of the revisions to the Supply Manual flowing from the change to the formal procurement plan process.
<br/>
 
<br/>
The Formal Procurement Plan format will continue to be used for procurements exceeding <abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Director General">RDG</abbr> limits but will now be approved at the <abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Director General">RDG</abbr> level with the exception of non‑competitive procurements (including non-competitive procurements where an advance contract award notice is used).</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> will continue to approve non-competitive procurements (including non-competitive procurements where an advance contract award notice is used). The <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> is to be notified, after approval of the procurement plan by the <abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Director General">RDG</abbr>, of sensitive procurements exceeding contract approval limits of <abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Director General">RDG</abbr>s. A copy of the signed procurement plan is to be sent to the <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr>. Examples of sensitive procurements include:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>The acquisition has been the subject of media attention in the past;</li>
<li>It is anticipated that there may be media interest in the acquisition;</li>
<li>The acquisition relates to the implementation of a significant policy decision;</li>
<li>The acquisition creates a long-term and significant financial commitment for the Crown; or,</li>
<li>The acquisition will or has been the subject of a Treasury Board Submission.</li>
</ol>
<p>The contract quality control review process changes: Formal procurement plans from Regional Quality Assurance will no longer be sent to Headquarters Contract Quality Control for input. Regional Quality Assurance will continue to review formal procurement plans.</p>
<p>Procurements for the services of former public servants in receipt of a pension exceeding <abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr> defined thresholds will no longer be approved by the <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> but will still require a formal procurement plan.</p>
<p>The process for Contract Requests does not change. For requirements at the <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr> contract entry approval limit, a Contract Request for authority to enter into a contract must be prepared for signature of the <abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr>.</p>
<p>The Contract Planning and Advance Approval (CPAA) will continue to be used for requirements up to and including <abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>/<abbr title="Regional Director General">RDG</abbr> limits, unless a procurement plan applies to the procurement.</p>
<p><a href="#PN-95annexa">Annex A</a>:contains the changes to the Supply Manual (SM). The current <abbr title="Supply Manual">SM</abbr> sections 3.1.1, 6.5.1.5, 6.20 and Annex 6.1 have been revised to reflect the new Formal Procurement Plan approval process.</p>

Column 2 is "Position" - it covers positions from Minister of PWGSC to Procurement Assistant. Column 3 is called "Standing Offers and Supply Arrangement" – it contains the authority dollar limits to use a Standing Offer or Supply Arrangement for positions – ranging from full for Minister to Max $1Million for Procurement Assistant. Column 4 is "Energy Management Contracts" – This column is sub-divided in two, which lists the Approval Authority for contract entry and approval authority for Aggregate of Amendments from the Minister of PWGSC to Manager position. uot;full" for all positions identified in Column 2.</p>
