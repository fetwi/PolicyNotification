<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Acquisitions Program implemented the <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/policy-notifications/PN-123"><abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>-123: Policy on the Phased Bid Compliance Process</a> (PBCP) on July 17, 2017.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Phased Bid Compliance Process">PBCP</abbr> provides Bidders/Offerors with an opportunity, after the solicitation closing date and time, to provide missing financial bid information or to comply with Eligible Mandatory Requirements.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Phased Bid Compliance Process">PBCP</abbr> Handbook supports implementation of the Policy on the <abbr title="Phased Bid Compliance Process">PBCP</abbr> by providing information on how the process must be applied and identifying the associated roles and responsibilities of Acquisition Program Procurement Officers, officials in client departments and agencies and evaluation teams. The Handbook also includes templates to be used in Requests for Proposal (RFP) or Requests for Standing Offer (RFSO).</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
