<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of Policy Notification 111 (PN-111) is to notify all Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) Acquisitions Program (AP) employees and any other persons providing procurement services on behalf of <abbr title="Acquisitions Program">AP</abbr> about the Public–Private Partnership (P3) procurement approach.</p>
<h2>Effective date</h2>
<p><abbr title="Policy Notification">PN</abbr>-111 and related changes to the <cite>Supply Manual</cite> are effective immediately.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Budget 2011 presented the Government desire for Canada to be a leader in <abbr title="Public–Private Partnership">P3</abbr>. The Budget introduced new measures that made it mandatory for departments and agencies to evaluate the feasibility of delivering infrastructure projects through a <abbr title="Public–Private Partnership">P3</abbr> procurement approach. Budget 2011 states: "Going forward, federal departments and agencies will be required to evaluate the potential for using a <abbr title="Public–Private Partnership">P3</abbr> for large federal capital projects. All infrastructure projects creating an asset with a lifespan of at least 20 years and having a capital cost of $100 million or more, will be subjected to a <abbr title="Public–Private Partnership">P3</abbr> Screen to determine whether a <abbr title="Public–Private Partnership">P3</abbr> may be a suitable procurement option. Should the assessment conclude that there is <abbr title="Public–Private Partnership">P3</abbr> potential, the procuring department will be required to develop a <abbr title="Public–Private Partnership">P3</abbr> proposal among possible procurement options".
